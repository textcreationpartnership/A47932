            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>Advertiſement TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving already ſpoken of thoſe Paſsions which reſpect Good. Wee were oblig'd to examine thoſe who have Ill for their Object. But becauſe the Soul may two waies conſider Ill; and that it is ſometimes an Enemy, which ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and ſometimes flyes; according to thoſe two ſeveral deſigns, ſhe alſo forms two Ranks of different Paſsions. The one of which may be call'd the Courageous, and the other the Timerous. For ſince Courage is nothing but a Power of the Soul, which employs the forces of the Animal to ſtop or overcome Evills, Wee need not doubt but thoſe Paſsions which ſerve thoſe purpoſes are conducted by the ſame Power; and that conſequently they
<pb facs="tcp:47499:7"/>ought not to be otherwiſe call'd, then Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Even as Such as dare not expect the Enemy, may certainly be concluded Timerous.</p>
                  <p>When the Soul indeed thinks her ſelf weaker then the Ill, She endeavors to ſhun the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and according to the motions ſhe makes to enſtrange her ſelf from it, ſhe forms Hatred, Averſion, Grief, Fear, and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire. But when ſhe thinks her ſelf ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrong to overcome it, or at leaſt to bear its aſſaults, then ſhe raiſeth up Boldneſs, Anger, and Conſtancy; which are the Couragious Paſsions, whoſe Nature and Characters Wee ſhall now examine. But perhaps, Reader, the Prepoſition wee have made and eſtabliſhed as the Principle of all the differences of theſe Paſsions, will beget a very reaſonable doubt, which thou would'ſt willingly have clear'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou entereſt on the Subject. For if the Soul thinks it ſelf ſtronger or weaker then the Ills, ſhe muſt compare her forces with theirs; and conſequently ſhe muſt Reaſon; foraſmuch as without reaſoning wee cannot compare one thing with another. So that the Soul of Beaſts which is ſuſceptible of theſe Paſsions muſt be oblig'd to reaſon, when ſhe would make uſe of them; And ſo ſhe would become Reaſonable. And ſo Reaſon would no longer be that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which diſtinguiſheth Man from other Animals.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:47499:7"/>
                  <p>Would'ſt thou but content thy ſelf with Reſolutions which are commonly given in the Schools upon ſuch like differences, I could eaſily reſolve this, ſaying that in theſe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhe forms no true Reaſonings, that they are only groſs and imperfect images of it, and that they are the effects of that inſtinct which God hath given to all Animals to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them, and guide them in their actions, But becauſe this anſwer is not capable to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy ſuch Minds who would clearly diſcerne things, and that the word Inſtinct ſeems to be in the rank of thoſe termes wherewith our Ignorance flatters it ſelf, and under which ſhe thinks to find ſhelter, I thought fit to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thy curioſity, and even to give ſome light to thoſe things of which I am hereafter to ſpeak; and therefore oblig'd my ſelf more exactly to inquire what the Nature of this Inſtinct, which makes ſuch a noiſe, and which ſo few under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, was; and to obſerve how far the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſenſible Soul can reach: and laſt of all to ſhew thee that there accrews no great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in believing that Beaſts reaſon.</p>
                  <p>And doubtleſs this was the place where we ought to examine theſe Noble &amp; famous queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which contain the Principles of all the Souls motions, and which may ſerve for a Preface and ground-work for all what we have to ſay of
<pb facs="tcp:47499:8"/>thoſe Paſsions, who have Ill for their object. Yet this Diſcourſe being ſomewhat overlong, and the difficulty of the ſubjects treated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in requiring a great aſsiduity of Mind, I thought it not fit to place theſe thornes at the entrance into the work, which perhaps might have diſguſted thee to have proceeded, or might have tir'd thee before thou wert arriv'd in the way wherein I would have engag'd thee; I therefore leave it at this time: yet if thy curioſity deſires ſatisfaction in things of that Nature, The Diſcourſe of the Reaſon of Beaſts is already printed, which yet for our mutuall ſatisfaction, I ſhall entreat thee not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the reading of, unleſs thou wilt perform it at once, and without interruption. Its a Diſcourſe whoſe parts are ſo linked together, that they cannot be divided without diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force and grace which the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt, wonder not if in the Pictures of the Paſsions I preſent, thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſome touches of vertues and vices; and if (for example) in the deſcription of Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thou encountreſt actions which ſeem to belong to valor and generoſity. I conſider Paſsion in its nature and in its eſſence; and as it is a motion of the Soul every where, where I know this Motion to be, I alſo acknowledge the Paſsion. So that vertue being nothing but a
<pb facs="tcp:47499:8"/>regulated motion, and a Paſsion moderated by Reaſon, and ſince a moderated Paſsion is ſtill a Paſsion, Diſcourſing in general of the Paſsions, I may ſpeak of thoſe which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Vertues direction, aſwell as thoſe which are directed by Vice.</p>

                  <p>THe Gentleman whoſe paſtime it was to Engliſh theſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, as they had pleaſed him, ſo he judged they could not but be grateful to an ingenuous Reader; and therefore commended them to the Preſs. And to ſhew how far he was from the new vanity of erecting his Statue in the front, he thought fit rather to uſe the practice of Painters, who, how well ſoever they may have copied Maſter-pieces, never ſet their names but to Originals; that as he pretends no Praiſe, he may thereby fruſtrate Cenſure. Yet he is conſident of his Authors merit, and that this Work of his will move love and delight in all but thoſe who are poſſeſt with malignant Paſſions; they indeed
<pb facs="tcp:47499:10"/>may quarrel with Love, oppoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, vex Joy, frown on Laughter, and even put Hope out of patience: but againſt ſuch, Laughter alone will be ſufficient. And for the reſt, if the Engliſh Chanel run too neer the French Coaſt, and that ſome may think the Tranſlation over-fraught with Galliciſms; perhaps they are ſuch as themſelves in their ordinary diſcourſe often uſe with affectation. But from them the Paſſions take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ſteer their courſe to the Ladies, acknowledging them the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Admirals of theſe Seas; to whom, whether they come ſafe, or are ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack'd, they of right belong, ſince none do more powerfully cauſe, or more ſenſibly ſuffer them; to whoſe fair hands I am obliged to preſent them, and from whom alone they promiſe themſelves protection.</p>

                  <head>A Neceſſary Advertiſement To the READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat I here preſent, is but a ſmall part of a Great Deſigne, wherein I intend to examine the Paſſions, the Vertues and the Vices, the Manners and Customs of People; the ſeveral inclinations of Men, their tempers, the features of their faces: in a word, in which I pretend to ſhew thee what is most excellent and most rare in Phyſicks, Morality, and in Politicks. I know thou already thinkest that my undertaking is full of Temerity, that it is beyond my ſtrength, and that there is no likelihood I ſhould ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh a Work, the least pieces whereof
<pb facs="tcp:47499:11"/>have ſtartled the greateſt men of the former times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I intreat thee, Reader, to conſider that I am but at the beginning of it, and that I ſhall not proceed without the knowledge of thy opinion and further advice therein. For if this Eſſay pleaſe thee not, and if thou believeſt that ſo rich a matter requires more expert and more cunning hands then mine, I am ready to quit the Work, and to finiſh it where I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced it: I ſhall at leaſt have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to have endeavoured to pleaſe thee, and to have found for thy divertiſement a deſigne which may paſs for the greatest and the fairest which was ever conceived, had it been but performed. And that I may give thee a more particular knowledge thereof, I will ſhew thee the Platform, and make it appear that ill Architects may have fair Capriccio's, and may ſometimes form noble Deſignes.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:47499:11"/>
                  <p>What I then propoſed to my ſelf, was, to preſent thee with <hi>The Art to know Men;</hi> which contains Five general Rules. The <hi>firſt</hi> is founded on the Characters of the Paſſions, of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and the Vices; and ſhews that thoſe who naturally have the ſame air which accompanies the Paſſions or Actions of Vertue or Vice, are alſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to the ſame Paſſions, and to the ſame Actions. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is drawn from the reſemblance Men have with other Creatures; and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that thoſe who have any part like to thoſe of beaſts, have alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations they have. The <hi>third</hi> is grounded on the beauty of the Sex; and ſhews that men who have any thing of a feminine beauty, are naturally effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; and that thoſe women who have any touch of a manly beauty, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate alſo of manly inclinations. The <hi>fourth</hi> is drawn from the likeneſs
<pb facs="tcp:47499:12"/>which the men of one Climat have with that of another. So thoſe who have ſhort noſes, thick lips, curl'd hair, and a tawny skin, as the Moors have, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſame vices to which they are inclined. The <hi>fifth</hi> and last may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Syllogiſtick, becauſe that without uſing particular ſignes, which uſually deſigne the Manners of perſons, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers them by diſcourſe and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: which is done by two principal means: The firſt is the knowledge of Tempers: for without knowing the ſignes of the inclination a man hath to be angry, ſo as we know that he is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, it will ſuffice to ſpeak him to be inclined to that Paſſion. The ſecond is the most ingenuous, and is drawn from the connexion and concatenation which the Paſſions and the Habits have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themſelves. So when we know a man is fearful, we may aſſure our ſelves that he is inclined to Avarice, that he
<pb facs="tcp:47499:12"/>is cunning and diſſembling, that he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpeaks ſofily and ſubmiſſively, that he is ſuſpicious, incredulous, an ill friend, and the like. And although we do not obſerve particular ſignes of all theſe later qualities, yet we believe they are found in him, becauſe we know the principle whence they deduce their origine.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the firſt ſtrokes which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the Platform of the Great Work we intend. For as all thoſe Rules are grounded on the relation which Men have with other things, its impoſſible to apply them well, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe very things. And it is bootleſs to ſay that any man is inclined to ſuch a Paſſion, becauſe he bears the Character thereof, unleſs we know what the Character thereof is. We muſt therefore make as many Diſcourſes as there are grounds for theſe general Rules; and divide the whole Work into ſeven parts.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:47499:13"/>
                  <p>The <hi>I</hi> ſhall treat of the Characters of the Paſſions, of Vertues and of Vices.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>II</hi> of the nature of the creatures which may be uſeful to this knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>III</hi> of the beauty of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of the inclinations which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>IV</hi> of the difference of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and manners of people.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>V</hi> of Tempers, and of the effects which they cauſe in the Minde and on the Body.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>VI</hi> of the connexion which the Paſſions and the Habits have amongſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>VII</hi> ſhall reduce in order all the ſignes which ſhall have been drawn from theſe great Springs; ſhall teach their uſe; and finally, ſhall ſhew <hi>The art to know Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Reader, you may perceive why I have undertaken the Characters of the Paſſions, and why I make it my firſt
<pb facs="tcp:47499:13"/>entry, and the Frontiſpice of my Work. But becauſe I therein obſerve a very particular Order, I thought it fit to acquaint thee with the Reaſons which obliged me to follow it.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe then the Paſsions are motions of the Appetite, by which the Soul ſeeks to draw neer Good, and to ſhun Ill; and that there are two Appetites in Man, The Senſitive, and the Intellectual, which is the Will. All the actions of the Senſitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite are called Paſsions, foraſmuch as the Minde is agitated by them, and that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſuffers and ſenſibly changeth in its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But all the actions of the Will, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are Motions, bear not the name of Paſsions: For there are two kindes of them; ſome, which are not for him who acts, but for another; as all actions are, whether juſt or unjuſt. Others, which are onely for him who acts them; as Love, Hate, Pride, and other Motions of the Will. The firſt are ſimply called Actions, or Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the other are called Paſsions, by reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:47499:14"/>of the likeneſs they have with the motions of the Appetite. In effect, the motions the Will makes for the good or ill which concerns it, are altogether like thoſe of the Appetite, if we did not conſider the alteration of the body which accompanies the later, and which is no part of the eſſence of the Paſsion, being but the effect. For the Will loves and hates, rejoyceth and grieveth, fears and hopes in the ſame manner as the Appetite, and hath with it its Concupiſcible and Iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part. However, Humane Paſsions, whether they be raiſed in the Will, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are formed in the Senſitive Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, are of two kindes: for ſome are Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are not to be found, but either in the Concupiſcible part, or in the Iraſcible: others are Mixt, and proceed from both together.</p>
                  <p>The Simple ones which come from the Concupiſcible part, reſpect the Good or the Ill, without conſidering whether there be either a difficulty in their purſuit, or flight
<pb facs="tcp:47499:14"/>from them; and are, <hi>Love, Hate, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Averſion, Pleaſure, Grief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe which belong to the Iraſcible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the difficulties there are, whether it be in the purſuit of good, or flight of Ill; and are, <hi>Hope, Deſpair, Boldneſs, Fear, Anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt conſiderable of the Mixt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are, <hi>Shame, Impudence, Pity, Indignation, Envie, Emulation, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, Repentance, Aſtoniſhment.</hi> For, <hi>Shame</hi> is a mixture of <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> cauſed by <hi>Infamy: Impudence</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Boldneſs</hi> we take in doing of diſhoneſt things. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation</hi> comes from <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> that we ſee Good or Ill happen to thoſe who are unworthy of it. <hi>Pity</hi> proceeds from the ſorrow we feel for other mens miſchiefs, and the apprehenſion we have of falling into the ſame affliction. <hi>Envie</hi> comes from Grief, and from Deſpair of poſſeſsing the Good which happens to another. <hi>Emulation</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:47499:15"/>ſprings from the regret we have not to enjoy thoſe perfections which we finde in others, and from the hope to attain them. <hi>Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> is a confuſion of <hi>Love,</hi> of <hi>Hate,</hi> of <hi>Fear,</hi> and of <hi>Deſpair. Repentance</hi> is bred from the ſorrow we feel for having done ill, and out of a hope of pardon. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Aſtoniſhment</hi> is mixt with <hi>Surpriſe, Fear, Grief,</hi> and <hi>Deſpair;</hi> as I ſhall make it appear in the Characters of every of thoſe Paſsions.</p>
                  <p>According to this Method, I ſhall firſt treat of the Simple Paſsions, and afterwards of the Mixt. And becauſe that amongſt the Simple Paſsions there are ſome which tend towards Good, others which aſſault Ill, and others which flee from it; I thought it more fit, in ſtead of ranking them, as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, with their contraries, to examine them after this Order, becauſe that they naturally keep it in their production, and that thoſe of one gender commonly are of a company; and becauſe their motions having
<pb facs="tcp:47499:15"/>a great agreement together, make one the other the better known; and ſo form <hi>Idea's</hi> more perfectly of every Paſsion, then if we mixt them with their contraries. You ſhall therefore here have thoſe Paſsions which have Good for their object, to wit, <hi>Love, Ioy, Laughter, Deſire,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hope.</hi> For I do not conſider <hi>Laughter</hi> as a pure corporal effect; but I comprehend therein the emotion of the Minde which cauſeth it; and, out of that reſpect, it may paſs for a particular Paſsion, and for a ſpecies of <hi>Ioy.</hi> But ſtick not at this: It is indifferent for my deſigne, whether it be one, or but the effect of one. There are many things which I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine not with the ſeverity of the Schools. Sometimes I diſtinguiſh thoſe they have not ſeparated; and I often confound thoſe which they believe to be different: Yet it never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, but when I am obliged thereto by the neceſsity of the Subject, which ſuffers me not always to enlarge my ſelf; or for the want in our Language, which in Dogmatical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
<pb facs="tcp:47499:16"/>is often poor and barren: In many places you may obſerve where I betray the purity and elegancy thereof in Phyſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms not yet approved, which yet I have been conſtrained to uſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, every Paſsion ſhall be divided into four principal parts. The firſt ſhall give you the Deſcription thereof: The ſecond ſhall ſhew its Nature: The third, the motion it cauſeth in the Spirits and in the Humours: The fourth ſhall diſcover the Cauſes of all theſe effects. There ſhall alſo be a fifth in Love, wherein I ſhall enquire the nature of Beauty in general, and why it cauſeth Love. Perhaps in that and divers other places, you will not finde the ſatisfaction you promiſed your ſelf, and I may be blamed for having obſcured thoſe things which ſeem moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by difficulties which were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. But before you condemn me, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thoſe things which we think were beſt underſtood, are often thoſe we leaſt know; that the beſt part of our ſelves is unknown
<pb facs="tcp:47499:16"/>to us; that we are ignorant of their nature, and of their motions; and that it is very difficult to penetrate thoſe depths wherein there is to be found nothing but a very great obſcurity. Yet have I thither brought all the light I could poſsible; and if I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it is great enough to ſhew thee all thoſe new Obſervations, I believe, I have taken. If they are right, I aſſure my ſelf that thou wilt no leſs eſteem them, then thoſe new lately diſcovered Stars, ſince our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is greater to know our ſelves, then the things which are without us. If I have not ſucceeded herein, yet it is very much that I have ſhewed the way, and marked the places which are to be followed. It is not that I beleeve I am the firſt who have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the want we had of a full knowledge of the Paſsions. There have been ſo many great Spirits who have wrought on this Subject, that it is impoſsible but they muſt have made better diſcoveries then I, of what was to be added. But as they are actions common to
<pb facs="tcp:47499:17"/>the Minde and to the Body, and Phyſick and Moral Philoſophy muſt help one the other to diſcourſe exactly of them; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that thoſe who have undertaken it, could never employ them both; and that thoſe who could have done it, have had other deſignes, which have hindered them from diſcovering to us the nature of theſe things, whoſe good or ill uſe cauſeth all the felicity or miſchief of our lives. In effect, if they are well regulated, they form the Vertues, and preſerve Health: but if they grow to exceſs, they are the ſource whence the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Soul and of the Body deduce their origine. And whoever would conſider the great number of Sickneſſes which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanily aſſault the life of Man, and the ſeveral ways whereby ſhe cuſtomarily loſeth her ſelf, will finde but few whoſe firſt cauſe was not ſome one of the Paſsions of the Minde. So that we may ſay, that the moſt profitable parts of Wiſdom and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick have not hitherto been diſcovered; and
<pb facs="tcp:47499:17"/>that if I have endeavoured to give them any part of my cares, and of my ſmall labour, I have not ſo much ſtrayed from my Duty and my Profeſsion as ſome may imagine. To conclude, what ſucceſs ſoever my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking have, it in my opinion deſerves ſome approbation, or at leaſt excuſe: and indeed, Reader, I muſt have both, to oblige me to purſue it. In a word, if thy judgement be favourable, it will afford me both very much glory, and very much pains.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>ATURE having deſtin'd Man for a civil life, thought it not ſufficient to have given him a tongue to diſcover his intentions; but ſhe would alſo imprint on his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and in his eyes, the images of his thoughts; that if his ſpeech <hi>happened</hi> to belye his heart, his face ſhould give the lye to his ſpeech. In effect how ſecret ſoever the motions of his ſoul are,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47499:19"/>what care ſoever he takes to hide them, they are no ſooner formed but they appear in his face; and the diſquiet they cauſe is ſometimes ſo great that they may be truely called tempeſts, which are more violent at Shore then out at Sea: And that he who adviſed a man to conſult his glaſs in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, had reaſon to beleeve that the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are better known in the eyes, then in the ſoul it ſelf. But that which is more wonderful, thoſe actions which ſpring from vertue and vice, diſcover themſelves in the ſame manner: And although the goodneſs or malignity they have, ſeem to have nothing to doe with the body, yet they leave with it, I know not what kind of images: And even the ſoul not perceiving what it doth, diſpoſeth the parts in ſuch a manner, that by the plight and poſture which they take, we may judge whether its actions are good or ill; Neither can the underſtanding work ſo ſecretly but the ſenſes muſt perceive it: If it elevate its thoughts, if it recollect it ſelf, the looks grow fixed, the car hears not; in fine, there is a general ſuſpenſion of ſenſe, and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And whether it be that at the ſame time the ſoul cannot intend ſuch different functions, or that the inferiour part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47499:19"/>and wil not divert its Miſtris, we know that this is imployed when the other operates not. Its a moſt certain thing that the body changeth and varies it ſelf, when the ſoul is moved, and that this performs almoſt no actions but it imprints the marks thereof, which we may call Characters, ſince they are the effects of them, and that they bear their image and figure.</p>
                     <p>Now, becauſe the firſt Rule of Phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy is grounded on theſe Characters, and that it maketh uſe of them to diſcover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, aſſuring us, that thoſe who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have the ſame air, and the ſame countenance which accompanies their moral actions, are inclined to the ſame actions; The deſigne which we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken makes us here propoſe the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Characters of all the Paſſions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them of Vertues, and Vices: But firſt we muſt know wherein theſe Characters conſiſt and what are the cauſes of them.</p>
                     <p>The Characters of Paſſions, and of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, being the markes of the motions, and deſigns of the ſoul, are alſo its effects, as is already ſaid; but becauſe there are alſo two ſorts of effects, thoſe which are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſoul, and thoſe which are effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the body; there are alſo two kinds
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47499:20"/>of Characters; the one <hi>Moral,</hi> the other <hi>Corporal.</hi> For if you conſider a man in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Violence appears in all his actions; his words are full of threats and injuries; he crys out, he runs, he ſtrikes; reaſon and remonſtrances offend him, and he knows no friends but thoſe who favour his paſſion. On the other ſide, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is inflam'd, his eyes ſparkle, he wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles his forehead, his words are fierce, his voice is terrible, his lookes are frightful, and his whole behaviour is furious. Theſe then are two kinds of effects, and two ſorts of Characters; the one whereof conſiſts in moral actions, and the other in the change and alteration of the body.</p>
                     <p>Now we muſt ſee what theſe actions are, and what this change is; for all moral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions cannot be uſed for Characters; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſome would be Characters of themſelves, ſince Paſſions, and Vertues, are moral actions.</p>
                     <p>To take away this difficulty, you muſt obſerve that the eſſence of human actions conſiſts in the inward emotion which the object forms in the appetite; and that all thoſe things which are done in purſuance thereof, are but as rivolets running from the ſame ſpring. So anger is nothing but a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47499:20"/>deſire of Vengeance; and in the purſuit of that emotion, the ſoul produceth exterior actions, which may ſerve to this purpoſe; as threatnings, blows, and other violences, which we call Characters becauſe they expreſs and diſcover the alteration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior motion of the appetite.</p>
                     <p>But there is alſo another thing to be here conſidered; and it is that when we ſpeak of Paſſions, of Vertues, and of Vices, we are not to conceive them as qualities, or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple actions; but as compleat qualities and actions which are accompanyed by many others, and yet, which all tend to one principal end which the ſoul propoſeth. For although love, (to ſpeake properly) is but a ſimple emotion of the ſoul, by which it unites it ſelf to that which is lovely; Yet we doe not therein form its whole Idea; we conſider it as a Paſſion that hath beauty for its object, and which to poſſeſſe it, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys deſire, hope, delight, &amp;c. In the ſame manner, Juſtice is a ſtedfaſt will to render to every one what belongs to him. But to effect it, ſhe makes uſe of Prudence, which makes her conſider the quality of perſons, the time, the place, and all other circumſtances. She makes uſe of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and of ſtrength, to moderate thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47499:21"/>paſſions which often traverſe her deſign; and although they are actions which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely concern her not, yet ſhe forbears not to appropriate them, becauſe they conduce to her principal end. Now all theſe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, and poſterior actions are alſo a part of moral Characters; becauſe they deſign the paſſion, or principal habit, which is the ſpring, and firſt cauſe whence they are derived.</p>
                     <p>Its far more difficult, to ſay wherein the <hi>Corporal Characters</hi> conſiſt, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention nature hath in forming them. We ſee, that every paſſion carries I know not what air on the face; that vertue ſheds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its actions a certain grace, and an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſpect, which is not to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the vitious; but as we have always called it <hi>The I know not what,</hi> it ſeems that we are thereby taught, that it could not be ſaid what it was. For I ſuppoſe, (as it is true) that the Characters we ſeek, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>air</hi> of which we have but now ſpoken. Now this is found in ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, that its almoſt impoſſible to obſerve what of common they have whereupon we may eſtabliſh its eſſence; for it moſt commonly happens in the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parts, and ſome have beleev'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47499:21"/>that this air was nothing but that motion. But its certain, there is a ſixt and natural air wherein the parts move not, and which is no effect of the ſouls emotions. So that it would be more likely, that this air were nothing but a certain relation of the parts amongſt themſelves; which happens from the ſituation they take when they move, or when they reſt: But nether is this ſufficient, ſince the colour which that relation compriſeth not, partly gives the air to the face; and that ruddineſs is one of the principal Characters of ſhame, as pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is of fear; this ever encreaſeth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, ſince that in defining beauty, we ſay that its a juſt proportion of the parts accompanied with a pleaſing colour, and with a grace; and that colour and grace are eſteem'd as two different things. For grace is nothing but a pleaſing air; nay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cuſtome, often applyes it to what it is not, when we ſay a man hath an ill grace; and in this caſe, grace is the ſame with air: That we may know then what this marvelous <hi>air</hi> is, where the ſerenity, and the ſtorms of the minde appear, we are firſt to obſerve, that the air of perſons is diſcovered in their pictures; that the grace of a fair face is expreſt by colours,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47499:22"/>and that conſequently, there muſt be ſomewhat of fixt, and which flyes not away, ſince there are none but ſtable and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things, which painting hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and that of all viſible objects, there is only motion, which ſubjects not it ſelf to the pencil. Now it is impoſſible to finde any thing ſtable, common to living things, and their pictures, beſides the figure and colour of the parts. So that it ſeems this air is to be there placed. But becauſe there is yet another thing in the grace, which the art of painting cannot attain to, and that there is a certain vivacity, which can never be fixt on the cloth; we muſt with reaſon beleeve that motion ſerves alſo to this grace; its that which renders the beauty lively and piercing; without which its ſad, dead, and without attraction. We cannot (in effect) doubt but that the motion of the parts gives ſomething to this vivacity, ſince 'tis a part of its perfection. But becauſe that after it hath ceaſed, there is yet I know not what which remains on the face, and that we ſee a certain ſplendor ſhine in the eyes, which depends neither upon their figure, motion nor colour; we muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily add to all this a certain ſecret influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which being ſent into the eyes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſeth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47499:22"/>it ſelf over the parts of the face; and without doubt, after having well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what it may be, we ſhall finde it to be the ſpirits which the ſoul continually ſends into thoſe parts, which leave there the brightneſs of the natural light they have; and indeed there are faces which neer ſeem well, and afar off appear very ill coloured, becauſe the ſpirits animate it not, and that the ſplendor they give is ſo weak that the ſpecies of it cannot reach far, and ſo they leave thoſe of the colour more withered. This grace then is in the colour, in the figure, in the motion of the parts, and of the ſpirits. And yet this doth not ſay that all theſe things are this grace: For were they in other ſubjects then man, they would not pleaſe; and green which is the moſt perfect of all colours, would cauſe a frightful deformity, were it on a face. It muſt then be, that as ſounds are not pleaſing of themſelves, but as they are in a certain proportion; ſo all theſe things are pleaſing to the ſight but only becauſe they have a certain relation, and a certain agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which pleaſeth the eyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents the minde.</p>
                     <p>To know this concordance, you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that there are two ſorts of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47499:23"/>in man; The Intelligible, and the Senſible. The firſt is but the interiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the juſt connexion of all faculties neceſſary for a man to perform the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereto he is deſignd; and the ſenſible beauty conſiſts in the diſpoſition which the Organs ought to have to ſerve theſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So that what renders the figure, the colour and the motion agreeable, is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which thoſe things have with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man. For how fair ſoever the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be, how perfect ſoever the figure of the parts are, how regular ſoever the motions are, if they are not conformable to his nature, they produce neither a beauty nor a grace; on the contrary, they cauſe a deformity, and render the body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly. Now although there be but God alone who knows the principle of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and why the forms have more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for one figure, colour, or ſome other accident then for another: yet there are in our ſoul ſecret ſeeds of this knowledge, which is the cauſe ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth herſelf in theſe objects without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon; in the ſame manner as ſhe findes them diſpleaſing, when that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and proportion which they ought to have is wanting.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47499:23"/>
                     <p>Some will perhaps ſay, that I here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found grace with beauty, placing grace in the proportion of the parts, and in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which in the ordinary definition of beauty are ſeparated from grace. But I beleeve there is no inconvenience herein, and that its true that all that is fair is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and that the proportion of parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair, muſt needs pleaſe the ſight, and that therefore they are graceful.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the ancients who in theſe things were wiſer then we, made not this difference, and always placed the graces where beauty was: For although <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> ſays, that little ones might be call'd pretty and pleaſing, but that they were not to be eſteem'd fair; 'tis that he ſpake of an entire and perfect beauty, which is not to be found in little bodies, for as much as they want that juſt proportion which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the perfection of man.</p>
                     <p>Yet there is ſome ground for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which hath been ſince made between beauty and grace; for as the matter and the form enter into the compoſition of man, we have placed beauty in the figure and in the colour which belongs to the matter, and grace in the motions which are effects of the ſoul: not that grace is not in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47499:24"/>the colour and in the figure; or that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not in the motions; but becauſe ſhe is more excellent in theſe, by reaſon that the ſoul who is the principle thereof, is more perfect then the matter, and that action is the laſt perfection of things. Beauty which ought to be the moſt agreeable, hath been call'd by the name of grace, although in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it ought to be common to all that is fair; and that the colour, figure and motion which have all their beauties, ought alſo to have every one their particular graces.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our ſubject; the <hi>grace</hi> is a kind of air and means; nothing more but that conformity and proportion whereof we have ſpoken. For when the <hi>air</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with this proportion, its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; ſo that this <hi>air</hi> in general is in all thoſe things which have a grace, and it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, <hi>A certain exterior and ſenſible quality which is bred from the colour, figure, and motion of the parts.</hi> And if we add that theſe things are proportionable, and conformable to the perfection of man, it will be the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of grace.</p>
                     <p>We are notwithſtanding to obſerve that the <hi>air</hi> appears more in one of theſe three things in ſome encounters then in the reſt: For that which is fixt and natural, is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47499:24"/>in the figure and ſituation of the parts. That which accompanies the paſſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends moſt from the motion and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; that of vertuous actions is ſometimes in reſt, becauſe reaſon hinders thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which would not befit the moderation and quiet ſhe ſeeks: ſuch is the grave and modeſt Mine, ſuch is the countenance of a man who meditates and thinks on great matters: And it may be that even vices which are in exceſs, have an active and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent air; and thoſe which are in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, have quite the contrary: ſo a hot and precipitate man is always in action, and the lazy is immoveable: beſides the <hi>air</hi> appears ſometime more in one part then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and although it be more remarkable in the face then in any other place, yet there is one which belongs to walking, another in the carriage of the armes, and another of the whole body. The French hath been more happy to expreſs thoſe differences then any other language, whatſoever. Not content to ſay <hi>l'Air &amp; la Grace, Air</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> it adds <hi>la Mine, la Contenance, le Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, le Geſte, &amp; le Port,</hi> which as neer as we can render them, are, The <hi>Mine,</hi> the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> the <hi>Behaviour,</hi> the <hi>Carriage,</hi> and the <hi>Port.</hi> The <hi>Mine</hi> chiefly belongs to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47499:25"/>face, <hi>the port</hi> to the gate, <hi>the carriage</hi> and the <hi>behaviour</hi> to the arms; the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Preſence</hi> to the whole body. And as the <hi>Port,</hi> and the <hi>Geſture,</hi> or <hi>Carriage,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note motion, ſo the <hi>Mine,</hi> the <hi>Behaviour,</hi> and the <hi>Preſence</hi> apply themſelves beſt to reſt: but the <hi>air</hi> and the <hi>grace</hi> are common to both of them. However it be, the <hi>air</hi> which is in Paſſions, and in moral actions, principally comes from motion; but you muſt know what the cauſe of this motion is: For upon this knowledge depends the greateſt part of what we are to ſay; and becauſe it will better appear in the paſſions, we will therefore by them begin the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
                     <p>We have already ſaid, and we ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be obliged to repeate, that Paſſions are nothing but the emotions of the appetite, by which the ſoul moves towards good, and eſtrangeth it ſelf from evil; and as ſhe hath divers organs which may be uſed to that end, ſhe alſo employs them, and moves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her intention: Now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits without queſtion are the firſt ſhe makes uſe of, being the moſt agil, and which take their birth from the ſame place where ſhe forms her deſigns; ſo that we need not wonder that they are the firſt to execute
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47499:25"/>them, ſince they ſeem to be the firſt who have the knowledge of them.</p>
                     <p>The ſoul then ſends forth the ſpirits, and ſcatters them over all the exterior parts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to acquire good, or to oppoſe ill: But when this is too powerful, and ſhe is ſenſible that ſhe is not ſtrong enough to reſiſt it, ſhe retires them in and brings them back to the heart. Now this flux and reflux brings two great changes, becauſe the humors being drawn along with them, their arrival ſwels and agitates the parts, and paints them of the ſame colour of which themſelves are: on the contrary, their flight makes them fail, looke pale, and renders them immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it would not be unprofitable to examine whether every paſſion hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular motion of the ſpirits; and whether anger moves them otherwiſe then ſhame, love, joy, or the reſt which carries them outwardly: Whether Fear retire them inwardly after another manner then Hate, Averſion or Greif. For if this were true, and that we could know theſe differences, we could with the more facility diſcover the cauſes of the alterations they produce. For my part, I beleeve that ſince in every Paſſion the appetite hath an emotion and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47499:26"/>a particular end, the means it uſeth ought alſo to be particular; and that the motion of the ſpirits muſt be conformable to the intention it hath, and to the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it gives it ſelf: and therefore that that is done in one paſſion, is different from thoſe which are done in others. So that its very likely that in one they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with impetuoſity, and high boylings like torrents: and in another ſlide as ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as rivers, that ſome make them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow their banks, others reſtrain them in their bounds: that now their courſe is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and preſently again irregular. Laſtly, That we may ſay love dilates them, deſire ſhoots them forth, Joy ſheds them abroad, Hope holds them faſt, boldneſs drives them, and that anger throws them forth in great boyling gulps, and ſo of the reſt, as we ſhall more particularly ſee in the diſcourſe of the Paſſions; although to ſpeak Truth, our ſpirit is not clear-ſighted enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern exactly all theſe differences, and that in this caſe the window of <hi>Momus</hi> were very neceſſary for it. How ever it be, the ſoul is not content after this manner only to agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the ſpirits and the humors in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: ſhe alſo cauſeth thoſe parts to move which are capable of a voluntary motion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47499:26"/>as being thoſe which are the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſeek and imbrace good, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or flye evil; and to ſpeak truth, this motion of the ſpirits is often a ſuccour ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeleſs to the ſoul, and which ſerves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhew her precipitation and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then to obtain what ſhe propoſed to her ſelf; for when they caſt themſelves into the face, ſhe fancies to her ſelf that it is ſhe her ſelf that runs thither; and when they retire themſelves to the heart, its ſhe alſo who hides her ſelf there, although ſhe be already at the place where ſhe would arrive, and that ſhe abandons not that wheene ſhe thinks to eſtrang herſelf; and what benefit is it to a Creature for the ſpirits and the blood to goe to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of an agreeable object, ſince nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſoul nor the body come nearer to it, nor are any more united to it, and that the ſences only are they which ought to make this union? we may ſay the ſame of the reſiſtance ſhe would make to thoſe ills which preſent themſelves; for what relation is there betwixt the ſpirits and an injury, and what effect can they make to drive back an ill which moſt commonly is only in opinion, which ſometimes is no more or which even is not yet made?</p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47499:27"/>
                     <p>But it is not thus with voluntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for indeed here the hands draw and take what's uſeful, the body is carryed towards what is lovely; it truly keeps a diſtance from whats ill, and flyes or drives away what incommodates it.</p>
                     <p>Its true that there are ſome of theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where the ſoul deceives it ſelf aſwel as in that of the ſpirits: how many loſt ſteps, ridiculous poſtures and idle words are there in Paſſions? to what uſe are theſe ſeveral motions of the head, thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent figures which the forehead, the eyes, the noſe, and the mouth form? There may be ſome relation with the deſign which the ſoul propoſed, ſince its certain that in ſhame ſhe caſts down the eyes, as if ſhe would hide herſelf, that ſhe lifts them up in Anger as if that ſerved to repel an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that in ſcorn ſhe lifts up the noſe as if ſhe would drive away what ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains. But its eaſie to perceive that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo ſhe deceives her ſelf, and that the blindneſs and trouble in which ſhe is, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her to uſe means which benefit her nothing to the obtaining of what ſhe deſires.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not that ſhe is therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in all theſe motions; there are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47499:27"/>many which happen without any deſign of hers; which although they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her intention, yet ſhe is not the cauſe of them, 'tis but by a certain neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that they follow thoſe motions which the ſoul inwardly excites; for we cannot with reaſon ſay, that ſhe propoſeth in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the hinderance of reſpiration and of ſpeech, the inflammation of the face, and the ſparkling of the eyes. But theſe are effects which follow the agitation of the ſpirits, which impetuouſly caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the exterior parts as we ſhall ſay hereafter.</p>
                     <p>By this diſcourſe we may not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what the cauſes of thoſe motions which the Paſſions excite are, but alſo which thoſe are which make moral Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and which make the corporal. For thoſe which the ſoul imploys by a clear and diſtinct knowledge to obtain the end ſhe pretends in every Paſſion, make the moral Characters; and thoſe which ſhe uſeth by a pure inſtinct, or which happen without any intention of hers, form the corporal Characters. For theſe latter are of two ſorts, the one are by the command of the ſoul, the other are by neceſſity, as you will ſee more particularly in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſes.</p>

                     <p>But this is it alſo that corrupts vertue, ruins ſociety, and renders art deſpicable.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47499:28"/>And if it hath truely brought into the world theſe excellent things, it ſeems it is only to drive them out again. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vigor which incites the minde to fair actions, that divine fire wherewith they ſay the ſoul is clothed, and which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſeth it towards Heaven, languiſheth and dys under the weight of baſe and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial things, upon which this Paſſion fixeth it. In ſhort its this that forms all the tempeſts which agitate our life there would be no grief, no fear, nor no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; were there no love; and who ever will neerly conſider all the paſſions, will eaſily beleeve that they are but ſeveral motions which it cauſeth, and different figures which it aſſumes.</p>
                     <p>Now as there are but few objects which can reach the ſoul, which are not able to move this paſſion: And whereas Riches, Honor, Pleaſure, and in a word all Goods whether falſe or true may raiſe it, we will not here diſimbroile this Chaos, and our deſign gives us not leave to ſpeak of any other kind of love but that which beauty begets in the appetite.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it a ſlight enterprize, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſtanding the helps thoſe great men of the times paſt have given us, and what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47499:29"/>endeavour ſoever we have already made to diſcover its origine, yet are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to confeſſe that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it which is divine, whereto our ſpirit cannot attain; and the ſame pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which we finde as they ſay at its birth, happens alſo in our thoughts when we would ſpeak of it; ſo that were it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to obſerve all the effects thereof, we might ſooner count the waves of the ſea, then the motions it cauſeth in the ſoul: neither doth heat produce or corrupt more things in the world, then love cauſeth both good and evil actions.</p>
                     <p>In effect its the inſtrument of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Art which Nature hath provided to preſerve her moſt exellent works; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it long ſince we had no more ſpoken of Families, of Peoples, or of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; and thoſe which were eſteem'd the moſt flouriſhing, had been but the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblys of a ſort of wild &amp; ſavage beaſts, had not love ſweetned and civilz'd them; for its it that forms us to a civil life, which is the true life of men, ſince thereby we become liberal, courteous, and generous; it teacheth us to be diſcreet, obedient, and faithful; it renders us abundant, eloquent, and ingenious; and for that ſame cauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47499:29"/>the wiſeſt man among the ancients for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, ſaid that he was ignorant in all things but in the art of love, foraſmuch as he eſteem'd that love is the ſchool of honor and vertue, and that whereſoever it reigns it brings peace, abundance and Felicity. And indeed had it not been alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by men, it had never produced any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereffects but thoſe, and we had not been obliged to have added to its Elogies, the crimes of which it is accuſed, and the ills which at all times it hath done through the whole world: but as the fire how pure ſoever it be, raiſeth ſtinking and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous fumes if it take in a corrupted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you are not to wonder if this divine flame being bred amongſt thoſe vices wherewith the nature of man is infected, produceth only filthy deſires, forms only evil deſigns, and if inſtead of the good things it ought to bring mankinde, it cauſe only troubles, anxiety and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</p>
                     <p>We have not undertaken here to give an account of all its diſorders, neither will we ſtain this diſcourſe with the blood and the infamy it hath brought into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and States, nor with the ſacriledges wherewith it hath violated the moſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47499:30"/>ſacred things; it will be ſufficient to ſay, that its the moſt dangerous enemie wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can have: For as much as of all thoſe paſſions w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> may diſturb her, there is only love againſt whom ſhe hath no defence; thoſe which enter nimbly and impetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the minde, are but almoſt of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments continuance, and reaſon finds its excuſe in their precipitation; thoſe others which move ſlowly by little and little, ſhe perceives them coming and can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtop their paſſage, or in that weak condition drive them away. But love ſlides in ſo ſecretly that its impoſſible to obſerve its entry, or its progreſſe, like a maskt enemy it advanceth and ſeazeth on all the principal parts of the ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is diſcovered, when there is no means to be found to get him out; then he triumphs, and wiſedom and reaſon muſt become his ſlaves: and 'tis what in my opinion the ancients would have ſaid when they fained Love ſometimes to be the Father of the gods, and ſometimes that he was a Demon which cauſeth them to deſcend from Heaven to Earth: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its certain that this paſſion hath maſtered the wiſeſt men in the world, and that it was not without cauſe that <hi>Lais</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47499:30"/>once vaunted to have ſeen more Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers with her, then of any other kinde of men. But let us leave theſe ſubjects for lovers to entertain their complaints withall, and without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſing our ſelves either in the praiſe or diſpraiſe of love, lets conſider from the Port where we are, the ſtormes it raiſeth in the ſoul and in the body.</p>
                     <p>The firſt wound that beauty gives the ſoul, is almoſt inſenſible, and although the poyſon of love be already in her, and that its even diſperſt through all her parts, yet doth ſhe not beleeve herſelf ſick, or at leaſt thinks not her miſchief ſo great. For as we doe not give to Bees the name they bear, but only when they have a ſting and wings: ſo neither is love called love but when he hath his arrows and can flye, thats to ſay when he is pungent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. At firſt we take it for a ſimple like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a complacency we bear to ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Perſon with whoſe preſence we are pleaſed, of whom we delight to diſcourſe, whoſe remembrance is ſweet; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires we have to ſee and entertain her, are ſo calm that wiſedom with all its ſeverity cannot condemn them, even ſhe approves them, and paſſeth them for civilities and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47499:31"/>neceſſary duties: but they are not long at a ſtand, they by little and little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and at laſt by the frequent agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou of the Soul, they kindle that fire which was there hid, and cauſe that flame to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe which burns and devours it; then this pleaſing image which never preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf to the minde but with ſweetneſs and reſpect, becomes inſolent and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; it enters every moment, or more fully to expreſs it, it never leaves it, it mixeth with its moſt ſerious thoughts, it troubles the moſt pleaſing, and profanes the moſt ſacred, it even ſlides into our dreams and by an inſufferable perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it ſhews it ſelf in them ſevere and cruel, when there is nothing to be fear'd, or abuſeth us with a vain hope when we ought truly to diſpair; then love who before was but a child, becomes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the paſſions, but a cruel Father, who hath no ſooner produced one, but he ſtiffles it to make room for an other, which he ſpares no leſs then the former; at once he cauſeth a hundred kinds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and deſignes to live and dye; and to ſee Hope and Diſpair, Boldneſs and Fear, joy and grief, which he cauſeth continually to ſucceed one another, Deſpight and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47499:31"/>which he makes to flaſh out every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; the mixture of all theſe paſſions; its impoſſible but you muſt fancie ſome great tempeſt where the fury of the wind raiſeth, throws down and confounds the waves, where lightning and thunder breaks the clouds, where light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, heaven and earth, ſeem to return to their firſt confuſion.</p>
                     <p>But as there are times when ſtorms are more violent and more common, there are alſo encounters wherein this tempeſt of Love is ſtronger, and more frequent. The chief in my opinion are, the preſence, and the abſence of the beloved perſon, her love, and her hate, and the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a rival; and we may ſay, that theſe are the five acts wherein all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and all the intricacies of this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are repreſented; at leaſt if there are others, they paſs behind the curtain, and out of the ſpectators ſight.</p>
                     <p>If it happen then that a lover be <hi>abſent</hi> from his beloved object, diſquiet and fretting purſue him everywhere, he hath no friends but are importunate, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements which were moſt pleaſing to him are troubleſome; in ſhort there is nothing in his life which diſpleaſeth him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47499:32"/>not, but ſilence and ſolitude, as if he were poſſeſt with thoſe ſtrange diſeaſes which makes us hate the light and men; he loves nothing but darkneſs and deſerts, there he entertaines the woods, the brooks, the winds, and the ſtars, they have nothing as he fancies but what is conformable to the humour of her he loves, and to the pains he ſuffers; he calls them inſenſible as ſhe is, and finds them like him in perpetual agitation, and after having a long time tormented his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with ſuch like Chimeras, he begins to think of thoſe happy moments when he ſhall again ſee that deſirable object that he may ſpeak to her, and give her an account of his ſighs and of the tears he ſhed in her abſence; ſometimes he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the complaints wherewith he muſt ſoften her rigor, the thanks with which he will receive her favours, and the vows wherewith he will confirm his ſervitude; ſometimes he puts pen to paper, he writes, blots out, tears, and if he have any thoughts which may ſecurely ſtay on the paper, they are thoſe only which witneſs the exceſs of his love and fidelity; and then what artifices doth he not imploy to procure the delivery of his letters? what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47499:32"/>extravagances doth he not commit when he receives any, or even when any thing that hath but touched the perſon he loves comes to his hands? he keeps them always joyned to his eyes or to his lips, he makes them his idols, and would not change them for Scepters and Diadems; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, we may ſay that abſence is the true night of lovers, not onely becauſe their Sun as they ſay illuminates them no more, but alſo becauſe that all their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are but as in a dream, and at that time all their ills are irritated and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                     <p>But lets conſider the day which followes this night, 'tis infallibly the <hi>preſence</hi> of the perſon beloved; indeed a lover calls it no other, who beleeves that when he comes neer it, all the beauty in the world is diſcovered to his eyes; he finds a new heat diſperſt through his ſoul, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mixture of joy &amp; aſtoniſhment cauſeth him ſo pleaſant a trouble that he is raviſht therewith and as it were out of himſelf: then how proud, bold or eloquent ſoever he be, he muſt humble himſelf, be afraid and loſe his ſpeech; it avails him nothing to have prepared his courage and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, they prove but ſo many dreams
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47499:33"/>and fantaſies which vaniſh at the ſight of this light; nothing but his eyes can ſpeak for him which witneſs by their looks what an exceſs of pleaſure and reſpect this meeting affords him; but what ever is ſaid, that this is the particular language of Love, there is yet another which is much more proper, and which is alſo far ſtranger then this: for although there are paſſions as violent as this, yet is there none which inſpires like this, ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and ſuch ridiculous words; for a lover ſcarce utters one probable word, what care and what intereſt ſoever he employs to make himſelf beleeved; all his diſcourſes and writings are perpetual hyperboles; he burns, he languiſheth, he dyes, he ſpeaks of nothing but of priſons, of chains, and of torments; he calls her he loves his ſun, his heart, his ſoul, and his life; he ſwears that he alone hath more love then all men beſides, that his paſſion is infinite and ſhall be eternal: In breif, all his words are beyond the truth, his deſignes and his promiſes beyond his power, and all his actions beneath his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; for there is no ſo baſe ſubmiſſion which he will not make; there is no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſo low or vile which he will not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47499:33"/>there is no ſubjection amongſt ſlaves ſo diligent, ſo careful and ſo expreſs as his; he often adores a perſon that diſdains him, courts a confident that betrays him, cheriſheth ſervants that mock him; he muſt uſe his enemies with reſpect, his friends with indifferency, and all the reſt of the world with ſcorn; he muſt ſuffer without complaining, he muſt fear all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire much, hope for little: in a word he muſt love his ill, and hate himſelf. I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt the profuſe expence he makes, the dangers he runs through to gain only a word or a favourable look, the tranſports of joy which a good reception yeelds him, the exceſs of grief and deſpair which a diſdain cauſeth, and the furies which jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie inſpires when a rival traverſeth his purſuit. When we ſhall ſpeak of thoſe paſſions in particular, then alſo will we ſhew the reſt of the extravagancies which love cauſeth, although indeed they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be all diſcovered. For beſides that there are no diſorders in the other paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are not to be found in this, that its capable of all the follies which can poſſeſſe a diſtracted mind, it hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faces and ſeveral countenances, that its impoſſible to take their picture; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47499:34"/>its violent and impetuous, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſweet and peaceable, in ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and toying, in others peeviſh and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, in other bold and inſolent, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther timerous and modeſt; it appears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and ſtupid, fantaſtical, light, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and in a hundred other faſhions, which in my opinion was the cauſe that ſome fained Love to be the ſon of the wind, and of Iris; to ſhew the wonder and the variety which there was in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to teach us that his original is as much hid as that of thoſe two kinds of Meteors. But before we undertake to diſcover it, lets ſee what change it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the face.</p>
                     <p>I do not beleeve that he who firſt painted Love with a vail before his eyes, intended thereby to ſhew the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is in that paſſion, but either through the debility or by the priviledge of his art, he was obliged to hide what he could not expreſs: In effect, what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, nay even what words can expreſs all the changes which Love cauſeth in our eyes? how can that reſplendent humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be repreſented which we ſee ſhine in them? that modeſt diſquiet, that laughing grief, and that amorous anger which is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47499:34"/>to be perceived in them; now you ſhall ſee them turn this way, and now that, now ſweetly lift themſelves up, by little and little fall down again and pittifully turn towards the beloved object. Sometimes they dwel on it as if they were fix'd, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they turn from it as if they dazled, ſometimes their looks are quick, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſweet and languiſhing; now they fly out with liberty, and now they ſteal and eſcape from between the lids; which ſeem as if they would ſhut upon them: In a word, all the motions wherewith the eyes in other paſſions are agitated are to be obſerv'd in this: you ſhall always finde laughter or tears, which ſomtimes agree &amp; mingle together; although they are ſunk and hollow, they do not therefore drie up or leſſen; on the contrary they ſeem big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more humid then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unleſs it be after a tedious grief or an extream deſpair, for then they become dry, dimm, caſt down and ſet. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in this paſſion ſeldom gathers it ſelf; on the contrary it ſeems as if it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and if ſorrow ſometimes caſts it down, the wrinkels do ſcarce ſo much as break its evenneſs; 'tis there where the redneſs begins to appear which Love
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47499:35"/>often raiſeth in the face, and even then when the other parts are pale, this always retains ſomething of its firſt colour; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the lips are red and moiſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pale and dry, and they never almoſt move without forming a pleaſing ſmile, ſometimes the undermoſt is ſeen to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and to whiten with a ſubtil froth, ſometimes the tongue paſſeth over them, and by a light touch and trembling which it gives, it flatters and tickles them; when it would form words it liſpes, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity which the deſire raiſeth in the mouth, ſtiffles and drowns them: Even the ears are of no uſe to a lover, he hears not half what you ſay to him; if he anſwers 'tis with confuſion, and his diſcourſe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment interrupted by deep and long ſights, which his heart and his lungs inceſſantly exhale: If he ſpeak of his paſſion 'tis with a trembling and ſoftned voice which he lets fall at every ſtroke by thoſe paſſionate accents, which deſire, grief, &amp; admiration uſually form: he grows pale, lean, &amp; he loſeth his appetite, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſleep, and if ſomtimes grief and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs overtake him, his ſlumbers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually interrupted by dreams, which do often more afflict his minde then the true
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47499:35"/>ills which he ſuffers. When the beloved perſon preſents herſelf to his eyes, when ſhe is but named, or when any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens his remembrance of her, at the ſame inſtant his heart riſeth, and is agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his pulſe becomes unequal and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and he grows ſo unquiet that he cannot ſtay in one place, ſometimes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeiſeth him, ſomtimes heat fires all his blood, ſometimes he feels himſelf anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an extraordinary force and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſometimes he is caſt down and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth, and even ſometimes he faints; laſtly he feels himſelf ſtrucken with a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which laughs at the Phyſitians skill and which findes no remedy but in death or in love it ſelf. But let's no farther, let us finiſh this diſcourſe with the artifice of the Painter as it begun, let's hide what we cannot deſcribe, &amp; be content to enquire the cauſes of thoſe effects which we have now obſerved in the eſſence and Nature of this Paſſion.</p>

                        <head>PART. 2. <hi>Of the Nature of</hi> LOVE.</head>
                        <p>ONe of the greateſt wonders in Love is, that this Paſſion being ſo general and ſo common, and wherewith we may ſay all knowing men have been touched, there hitherto hath none been found who hath clearly diſcovered its nature and origine; for after having ſeen all what hath been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereof, we may affirm that the love of Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oſophers was as well blind as that of Poets: and that he who ſaid it was I know not what, which came I know not whence, and went away I know not how, made not one of the worſt encounters: Now although I will not examine all the definitions which are given it; the bounds which I have preſcribed being too narrow to permit ſo long a diſcourſe; yet there are ſome which are eſteem'd the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, whoſe defects I muſt obſerve
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47499:36"/>that I may well eſtabliſh that which I mean to propoſe; and you may wonder that I approve not that of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was more knowing in Love then all the Philoſophers in Antiquity; nor that of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> who underſtood Morality bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any man after him; So that I am oblig'd to tell you the reaſons which make me diſſent from their opinions, And which make me ſteer another courſe then they have done.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, who defin'd Love to be <hi>a deſire of Beauty,</hi> he confounds two Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in one, nay even he deſtroys them both, ſince deſire moves only towards thoſe things which we have not, and is quenched when we poſſeſſe them: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Love continue in its poſſeſſion, and even ſometimes therein renders it ſelf more violent; and then if love be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it would be no more Love, ſince we cannot deſire what we enjoy; and by the ſame reaſon deſire would no longer be deſire. I know well you will ſay, that there is no poſſeſſion ſo entire and full where deſire may not finde its place, and were it but the continuation of the good we enjoy, 'twere ſufficient to employ it, and to render it inſeparable from Love:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47499:37"/>but this eſcape is unprofitable; for if the poſſeſſion be not entire, it ſuppoſeth a part which yet we have not enjoyed; and who wiſheth the continuation of a good, conſiders it not as preſent but as a thing to come; and therefore he forms a new Idea of the good he poſſeſſeth, and hath a different motive from that which its preſence gives, and this is enough to cauſe two ſeveral paſſions; otherwiſe we ſhould confound Love with Hope, and even with all the other motions of the ſoul, which are often found by one only object according as we conſider it ſeveral ways.</p>
                        <p>For S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who ſays that Love is <hi>a complacency of the appetite in the thing which is lovely;</hi> either he takes the word compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency for the ſutableneſs which the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite finds in the object which the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation propoſeth; or elſe for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and the joy which the object yeelds it; if it be that ſutableneſs, it is formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Love; if it be the pleaſure, it follows it: For its certain that when the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the underſtanding have judged a thing to be good, the firſt thing the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite doth, is to agree &amp; conſent to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they made of it; and although
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47499:37"/>this more clearly appears in the will then in the ſenſitive appetite; becauſe the will is free to conſent or refuſe what is propoſed to it, and that conſent ſeems to be an act particular to it; yet there is in the appetite a certain image of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and its likely it approves what the imagination preſents before it carries or moves it ſelf towards it; and this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and agreement is the complacency of which we ſpeak; which is nothing elſe but the ſatisfaction and the quiet the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite takes at ſight of the objects which are conformable to it. So light rejoyceth the eyes even before it move the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; and the pleaſure they receive in this encounter, is not a Paſſion nor a Motion, but a certain calm which coms from the conformity of the object with that power: The ſame happens to the appetite; when the imagination propoſeth any thing that is lovely, it afterwards likes and moves to poſſeſs it; ſo that this agreement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes Love, and Joy follows it, as you ſhall perceive by the ſequel.</p>
                        <p>To form then a definition of Love without theſe difficulties and defects, we are firſt to ſuppoſe the difference betwixt that Love which is a habit, and that which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47499:38"/>is a Paſſion; for being a Motion, when that Motion ceaſeth, the Paſſion alſo is at an end, and we may ſay, that there is no more Love; but the habit forbears not to be there ſtill, which is nothing elſe but the impreſſion of the beloved object which remains in the Mind, and which cauſeth that at all times when the thought propoſeth it to the appetite, it moves and forms the paſſion of which we ſpeak; the Paſſion of Love is then a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and becauſe Motions draw their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from the end whereto they tend, we are to obſerve what its end is. Now as the appetite ſtirs not but to poſſeſs good and fly from ill, we cannot doubt but the poſſeſſion of good is the end of Love; but as we cannot poſſeſs a thing without in ſome manner uniting our ſelves therunto; it neceſſarily follows that Love is <hi>a Motion of the appetite by which the Minde unites it ſelf to that which ſeems good unto it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its true that at firſt this will not ſeem true, becauſe that moſt commonly in Love the beloved object is abſent, with whom it is not likely the ſoul ſhould unite it ſelf; but if you conſider that objects may be united to the powers by their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47499:38"/>ſpecies and by their images, or by their true beings; and that conſequently there is a real union, and another that is not, which the ſchools call intentional, and which we may name Ideal; you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the union which the appetite makes with the object which the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation propoſeth, is of the latter rank; becauſe the true being of things enters not into the imagination, its their Idea and their image only; and this union is that alone which naturally belongs to the appetite, for that it can no otherwiſe for its part unite it ſelf to the good which is preſented unto it; if it move towards any other union 'tis not for it ſelf that it ſeeks it, but for other powers which may really unite themſelves to their objects: for the the appetite is a politick faculty which works not only for it ſelf, but for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are beneath it: and as the imagination is the Center of all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the appetite is it alſo of all the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which are in the parts; ſo that the imagination or the underſtanding propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to it what is fit, it ſeeks it for them, and endevors to procure them the enjoyment thereof; and then if they are capable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to unite themſelves with their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47499:39"/>it covets their union; but this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not but that it unites it ſelf before with them by a union proper to it, and which is as the principle and ſpring of all other unions belonging to the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you will ſay that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the imagination in the ſame manner unite themſelves to what is fit for them, and that therefore Love may be aſwel formed there as in the appetite; but the difference is great, becauſe that the objects come and go in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and in the imagination; and the knowledge they have of them is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gained by reſt then by motion, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſtotle</hi> ſays, quite contrary to the appetite which moves it ſelf towards its object and goes out as it were of it ſelf to unite it ſelf thereto; ſo that the union which is made in the underſtanding and in the imagination, is purely paſſive without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny motion of its faculties: but that of the appetite is active and performed with agitation, conſidering alſo that the union made by the appetite is more perfect then that which is made by knowledge; for as much as the minde may have an averſion from ſome
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47499:39"/>thing which it hath conceived, which is a kind of ſeparation, and therefore the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof is not ſo perfect as that of the appetite, which cannot endure this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and which conſequently is the moſt accompliſhed which can be found in the actions of life.</p>
                        <p>But if Love be a motion of the Soul to unite it ſelf to what is lovely, it ſeems as if when it is united thereunto, there then ſhould be no more motion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no more Love; and as this union may be made in a moment, for that there is nothing can hinder it, it ſeems as if this motion alſo were made in an inſtant; and that therefore Love ſhould not laſt any longer, which would be a very ſtrange propoſition and contrary to the truth.</p>
                        <p>To anſwer this objection, you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that there are things which move themſelves to attain to ſome end ſeparate from their motion; and that there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which finde in the motion it ſelf the end they ſeek; the firſt ceaſe to move when they have attain'd their end; But thoſe who have no other end but motion, or at leaſt none that is ſeparated from their motion, never pretend to reſt; and as reſt is a perfection in thoſe, ſo 'tis an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47499:40"/>in theſe; now the appetite is of this latter kinde, which truly moves to unite it ſelf to what is good, but the union it ſeeks cannot be effected but in motion, and when that ceaſeth it vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; ſo that whileſt the beloved object is preſent it muſt inceſſantly agitate it ſelf to obtain the end it deſires, which is to unite it ſelf thereunto; and if it chance to reſt, it proceeds from that the object is no longer preſent with it, or at leaſt that it is no more offered unto it as good; Love then is a motion and a union of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to what is lovely whether abſent or preſent; becauſe its abſence hinders not the imagination from propoſing the Idea thereof to the appetite, which is the only one with which it naturally can unite; its true that working for other powers (as we have ſaid) it ſtops not at this ſimple uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it ſeeks what is fit alſo for them; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for the ſeeing and hearing that their objects may be at a reaſonable diſtance; for touching and taſting, that theirs may be immediatly united to their organs; In fine as many ways as things can be united, the appetite and the will wiſh a fit union for them; and you muſt confeſs that the concourſe of all thoſe motions makes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47499:40"/>the Paſſion of Love compleat and entire, and the firſt of which we have ſpoken, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it contains all its eſſence and its form, yet hath it not all its extent; we may ſay it is the ſource, and that the others are the brooks which encreaſe it.</p>
                        <p>Lets now ſee what this particular agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, which the appetite cauſeth to make this union, and in what its different from that which is to be found in Joy, in Deſire, and in Hope, by which as wel as by love, it ſeems that the ſoul would unite it ſelf to the good which is preſented to it. For tis not ſufficient for the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Paſſions to ſay that they are motions, unleſs you obſerve the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe motions, and unleſs you make known the different impreſſions; and the diverſs progreſs which the diverſity of theſe objects cauſe in the appetite.</p>
                        <p>You muſt then ſuppoſe there is ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between the motions of the Soul and thoſe of the body, and that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which are found in theſe in ſome manner happen in the others. For ſince the effects are like their cauſes, the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body which are the effects of the Soul, ought to be the images of that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47499:41"/>agitation which it gives it ſelf. In effect they ſay that the underſtanding moves directly towards its object, that it reflects and redoubles it ſelf on it, that it reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it ſelf, that it wanders and confounds it ſelf; which are all phraſes drawn from ſenſible motions and which ought to make us beleeve that ſomewhat like it is done in the ſoul, and chiefly in its appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titive part, becauſe it is by it that in effect it moves and agitates it ſelf; neither is it to any purpoſe to ſay that they are not true motions, but that they only are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical; for beſides that you muſt confeſs that all definitions of the Paſſions where the word <hi>Motion</hi> is always uſed, are Metaphorical; its nevertheleſs certain that there may be a reſemblance between both although they are of ſeveral kinds: But I ſhall ſay farther, that to conſider exactly the corporal motions, we may ſay they are not ſuch perfect and true moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as thoſe of the ſoul, and that they are but groſs and imperfect images of them; ſince its true that in the order of things, thoſe which are inferiours are more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and more perfectly in the ſuperiors, and that all of them are but copyes drawn the one from the other, whoſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47499:41"/>original is in the Soveraign Idea of all beings.</p>
                        <p>How ever it be, ſince that in defining Paſſion in general the word <hi>Motion</hi> is uſed, we muſt neceſſarily obſerve the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Paſſions, and therein employ the differences of Motion, and finde in every of them ſome particular agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath an agreement and relation to ſome of the ſenſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>To diſcover then that which is moſt fit for Love, we muſt firſt know where the image of good is; and whether it dwels in the imagination, or whether it inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it ſelf into the appetite; it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that if the appetite go abroad to ſeek it, it ought to agitate it ſelf in another manner then if it comes home to it; its true it is not eaſie to be decided, and take which ſide you will, you will finde incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which ſeem inevitable: For, if the image of good iſſues not out of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, the appetite which is a blind power can never know it; and therefore ought not to move to unite it ſelf to it not knowing it to be there: To ſay alſo that it comes forth of the imagination and ſlides into the appetite, it will be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47499:42"/>there by the ſame reaſon, ſince it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerves to repreſent things and give ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, which the appetite is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; beſides its hard to conceive how this image can run from the imagination into another power, becauſe beſides that the accidents cannot paſs from one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another, its the term and formal effect of an immanent action, which hath this property never to go out of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty wherein it was produced.</p>
                        <p>To avoid theſe entanglings, and that we may no farther engage our ſelves in the doubts of the ſchools, we muſt ſay that the image which is in the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in effect goes not out of it for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we have diſcourſed; but as in the preſence of luminous bodies, light is ſhed through the air which environs them; ſo when this image is formed in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it multiplies in all the parts of the Soul, it enlights them and excites after them thoſe which are capable to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Its even very likely that 'tis in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a refined and purified light, ſince the images of corporal things which ſtrike our eyes are nothing elſe but lights as we have ſhowen in its place; and that there is nothing more conformable to the mind
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47499:42"/>then this quality which is as the middle, or horizon of ſpiritual and corporal things; however it be, we ought not to doubt but theſe images are as well multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed as thoſe of the body, ſince they are more excellent, and that we have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured proofs of them in the effects of the memory and the forming faculty, which ought neceſſarily to be imbued with theſe images, to form parts conformable to the deſigne which the imagination of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten propoſeth contrary to its ordinary conduct.</p>
                        <p>But if it be true that theſe Ideas are only fit to repreſent things, and give you the knowledge of them, how can they be uſeful to thoſe faculties which know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as thoſe are of which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? We muſt anſwer that there are two kinds of knowledge, the one clear and diſtinct which belongs to the ſences, to the imagination, and to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: the other obſcure and confuſed, which is in the appetite and in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther powers, which have a natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their objects, and of what they are to do.</p>
                        <p>Its then true, that the image of good is in the imagination, as a light which ſheds
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47499:43"/>its rays into the appetite, which inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, and afterwards excites it to move to unite it ſelf thereunto: For although it be multiplyed, and that the appetite be full of the ſplendor it caſts, it contents not it ſelf with this influence; it ſeeks to unite it ſelf at the Center, and at the ſpring whence it comes; as we may ſee it happens to iron, which having received the magnetick vertue moves towards the Loadſtone, which is the principle and ſource thereof, that it may the more ſtrictly unite it ſelf thereunto.</p>
                        <p>So that its very likely, that to form the Paſſion of Love, the appetite carries it ſelf ſtrait towards the Idea of good which is in the imagination, and that this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is like to that of all other natural things, which move thus toward what is conformable to them.</p>
                        <p>But this breeds great difficulties; for though you may conceive this kinde of motion in the ſenſitive appetite, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it is placed in an organ different from that of the imagination, and that there is a ſpace between both, where we may fancy that this motion is made; this cannot take place in Love which is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſuperior part of the Soul, where
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47499:43"/>the will is not ſeparate from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and towards which conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it moves not it ſelf, ſince it's always naturally united to it; moreover I ſay, were the ſenſitive appetite only in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it's hard to comprehend how it could move thus; for there is no likelyhood that it ſhould go out of its place and from its organ to joyn with that of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſince all its motions are immanent actions; if likewiſe it doe not go out, how ſhould it unite it ſelf to this Idea which is in the imagination?</p>
                        <p>To reſolve theſe difficulties, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer theſe ſeeming urgent reaſons, we are to remember that the motions of the Soul, although they have conformity with thoſe of the body; yet are they not altogether like them, and if they parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate ſomewhat of their nature, yet have they none of their defects. For they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not that ſucceſſion of time, nor that change of place which is alwayes found in thoſe, and which are neceſſary follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the imperfections of the matter: they are made in one moment and in one place, at leaſt they do not goe out of that power where they are formed: for you muſt not think that the appetite in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47499:44"/>toward good or from evil quits its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bounds, and that it paſſeth from one place to another like animated bodies. All theſe agitations are made in it ſelf; and as water which is ſhut up in a gulf may move in ſeveral manners without iſſuing out; ſo this power which is as an abyſſe in the ſoul, may be ſeveral ways agitated within its own bounds, and by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tranſport of its parts ſometimes daſh againſt its bounds, ſometimes retire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its Center; in a word make all the motions which are to be obſerved in the Paſſions. It is not then neceſſary that the will be ſeparate from the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that there be a ſpace betwixt the two, to cauſe the motion of which we ſpeak agitating it ſelf in it ſelf, and drive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its parts towards the Idea of good which is repreſented it by the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; it unites it ſelf to it as much as it can, and ſo canſeth the Paſſion of Love; it is juſt ſo with the ſenſitive appetite; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though its principal organ be far from that of the imagination, we muſt not beleeve that theſe two faculties are quite ſhut up in theſe parts, they diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through the whole body and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes joyned together, as we will more
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47499:44"/>at large ſhew in the diſcourſe of Joy. So that the motion which is there made is like that of the will; and in the one and the other, Love is but a motion of the appetite, which directly carries it ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Idea of good and unites it thereunto, which is not effected in the reſt of the Paſſions: as we will make it appear.</p>
                        <p>You have now ſeen what Love is in general, whence its eaſie to obſerve its differences, by the differences of thoſe objects which may move it: for as there are goods of the minde, of the body, and of fortune, and as every of them is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, uſeful or delightful: its certain that although the motions whereby we Love all theſe things are of the ſame nature, and that in general they have the ſame end, which is to unite the appetite to what is good; yet are they different between themſelves, becauſe theſe goods are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; ſo there is a Love of Riches, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Honours, and Vertues; in a word, as many as there are kinds of falſe or true goods, ſo many ſorts of Love there are, of which we have here no intention to ſpeak, becauſe the greateſt part of thoſe kinds are comprehended in the vertues
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47499:45"/>and the vices of which we ſhall treat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; And becauſe we have reſtrained our ſelves to that Love which beauty breeds in the appetite.</p>
                        <p>This Love may be defined <hi>a Motion of the appetite, by which the ſoul unites it ſelf to what ſeems fair unto it:</hi> So that all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity that there is betwixt this definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that of Love in general, conſiſts in beauty; wherefore we have two things to examine. Firſt what beauty is; in the ſecond place, why it cauſeth Love; but becauſe this ſearch is extreamly high and difficult, and that it may break the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of this diſcourſe, we have remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the end of this Chapter, to ſpeak of the effects which Love cauſeth in the humors and in the ſpirits.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>SInce that the motions of the ſpirits and of the blood are in the Paſſions conformable with thoſe which the Soul feels in it ſelf: There is no doubt but that Love uniting the appetite to the Idea of the good which is repreſented to it, produceth alſo in the ſpirits a certain motion which ſeconds its deſign, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this union the more forcible: but as the ſences ſerves us but little to know the difference of theſe motions, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding muſt ſupply their defect, and muſt by diſcourſe ſhew us what this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirits is which is the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſince 'tis that which ought to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this Paſſion, to which end you muſt ſuppoſe two things to be moſt true: The firſt that the Heart is the chief organ of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47499:46"/>the ſenſitive appetite; The ſecond that the Brain is that of the imagination: now as the Idea of good is formed in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and the motion of the ſpirits begins at the Heart, the ſoul muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity having a deſign to unite them to the good it hath conceived, transport them from the place where they begin to move, towards that where they are to meet this object: And becauſe this firſt birth of Love is from the inward union of the appetite whereof we have ſpoken; the firſt motion which the ſpirits alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer muſt drive them to the brain, where it ſeems this union ought to be; for the Idea goes not out of the Faculty which produceth it, as hath been ſhowen; and foraſmuch as the ſpirits carry with them heat and blood, from thence it comes that the imagination of Lovers is heated, and afterwards brings forth ſo many fair productions, and ſometimes too extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, if the motion and heat be too violent; we may ſay beſides that the pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is ſo common to them, partly comes from the tranſport of the ſpirits which are within the brain, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the face, leave it without heat or ſplendor: but if the beloved object be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47499:46"/>preſented to the ſences, then do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of theſe ſpirits run to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts colouring them with the blood they draw along with them, and which is the pureſt of the veines as we will ſhew you anon. Its true there are Paſſions which mingle with this, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cauſe a contrary motion (to that whereof we have ſpoken) in the humors: But we ſhall conſider here only the effects proper to Love, and not thoſe he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows from others; ſo that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the firſt effect of Love upon the ſpirits, is, to ſend them out of the heart, and to tranſport them to the brain and to the exterior parts.</p>
                        <p>But this is not enough, we ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whether in this motion they move either with liberty or with conſtraint; that's to ſay, whether they dilate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain themſelves. For theſe ſeem to be the two firſt differences of local motion: now as there are but two encounters which may oblige the ſoul to reſtrain the ſpirits in their Motion; to wit when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe repels or flyes from what's ill; becauſe in the one ſhe hath a care of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying her ſelf, and to that end to gather and reunite the ſpirits; and in the other
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47499:47"/>the flight is not made without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which precipitates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds them together; its evident that there are none of theſe motions in this Paſſion, which conſidering nothing but the goodneſs of its object, it ſees no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which it would aſſault, or that it ought to fear; ſo that it agitates the ſpirits with liberty, it dilates them and ſeems to open them, the better to receive the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good, and ſo the more perfectly to unite it thereunto.</p>
                        <p>Let's go on and ſee whether this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be unequal, and whether it be made with that vehemency which happens in impetuous Paſſions. Its certain that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger moves the ſpirits and the humors with more confuſion and diſorder then Love, by reaſon of divers and often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours which the minde is forced to make to drive out the ill; and that it is like thoſe Torrents whoſe waves precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate themſelves one upon the other, and make a ſtream full of boylings and foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but that Love makes the ſpirits and the blood ſlide in the veins, in the ſame manner as water runs in the Channels of Fountains, or in Rivers, whoſe beds are large and even; for Love which dilates
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47499:47"/>the ſpirits, proportionably enlargeth the veſſels, and ſo giveth them the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, it renders their courſe leſs turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and confuſed. But the chief reaſon of this equality, is, becauſe Love hath commonly no other Paſſions following it, which have contrary motions, as anger which is always accompanied with grief, and which retires the ſpirits towards the heart, at the ſame time when it drives them forth.</p>
                        <p>For although Joy, Deſire, and Hope, which are almoſt always with Love, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly move the blood, yet they doe not imprint motions quite oppoſite, as we ſhall make it appear; ſo that it is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that tumult, nor to that unequal agitation which the contrarities cauſe in fluid bodies; but with what violence ſoever it be driven, all its parts flow equally and without confuſion; and there is no doubt but that ſecret joy which Lovers feel without thinking even of the beloved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, proceeds from ſome kinde of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe impreſſion remains in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors after the ceſſation of the minds agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For as Nature loves order and equality in all her actions, when ſhe ſees the motion of the blood conformable to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47499:48"/>her inclination, ſhe is ſenſible of a certain joy whoſe image or ſhaddow preſents it ſelf to our minds, and diſpoſeth us to mirth without knowing the cauſe; and I beleeve for the ſame reaſon, that if the humors were always agitated with this flux, and reflux, which the oppoſite Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions uſe to cauſe, there would not be a moment in Love exempt from grief and perplexity; and that thoſe exceſſes of joy would never be felt, which ſo often happen, becauſe that the ſoul cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer contrary motions, but that ſhe muſt at the ſame time ſuffer ſome pain, and ſome kinde of grief. But what ſhall we ſay then when theſe turbulent Paſſions, as Anger, Fear, and Deſpair, mingle with Love? ought it to give them place when they enter the minde and dye when they ſpring forth, ſeeing its motion is contrary to theirs? truly I beleeve, that the habit of Love remains ſtill, but the Paſſion ceaſeth when another deſtroys its motion, and principally if it be violent; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a man in anger or poſſeſſed with fear thinks not on the beloved object, and at the leaſt the thoughts he hath of it, are ſtiffled by thoſe of revenge or of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he would ſhun. Its true that as theſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47499:48"/>Paſſions enter inſtantly into the minde, they commonly go out as readily, when at the ſame time the firſt returns, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the beloved object furniſhing new Idea's which awaken the appetite, and cauſe therein a new commotion, which is nothing difficult to beleeve, if we conſider that the appetite and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are agitated more eaſily then the air, And that their motion is in ſome manner like that of lightning, which pierceth the clouds in an inſtant, which followes flaſh after flaſh, and leaves no trace of the way they made: And if theſe Paſſions are weak, they may be well enough compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with Love, but they diminiſh its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; becauſe the ſoul dividing it ſelf to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral objects, cannot wholly give it ſelf to what is lovely; and becauſe the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which this cauſeth in the humors is hindred, by the flood of thoſe others which oppoſe its courſe.</p>
                        <p>Now let's ſee what this vehemency is, which accompanies this motion of the ſpirits, and whether it be as great in this Paſſion as it is in anger, in fear, and in the reſt. For its certain there are ſome which naturally are not ſo violent, as Hope, and Compaſſion, where there
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47499:49"/>never is thoſe extreme tranſports which are to be obſerved in the reſt. Now you muſt not think that Love is as the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that it hath the moderation they have; the ſallies it makes, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts it raiſeth are ſometimes ſo great that it wracks the minde; and the alteration which all the body ſuffers in thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters is an evident witneſs that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are moved with a great impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the beginnings truly are ſweet, and we may ſay they are like to thoſe peaceable winds which a weak heat raiſeth, and which afterwards change into whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windes when it grows ſtronger; for as at the birth of this Paſſion the Idea of the beloved object makes no great impreſſion in the minde, being if we may ſo ſpeak, but lightly and ſuperficially printed, ſo it alſo cauſeth in the appetite but a light emotion; but when it hath inſinuated it ſelf into the bottom of the minde, and hath rendered it ſelf maſter of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then it puiſſantly raiſeth all the moving faculties, and cauſeth thoſe great ſtorms which often make us loſe both our reaſon and our health.</p>
                        <p>Yet will I not ſay when the ſoul is come to this exceſs, but that the appetite
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47499:49"/>and the ſpirits are continually agitated with this violence; I confeſs the tempeſt is not always alike, that it often abates and even diſſipates it ſelf; whether it be that the divers deſignes this Paſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires, divert the Soul from its firſt and principal thoughts, or that all things which are in nature cannot always laſt in one violent eſtate, and that the minde is weary to be long ſtretched towards one object; whence it happens that the ſtrongeſt Paſſions at laſt become languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and quiet themſelves; and indeed thoſe great tranſports of which we ſpeak, are never but when the beloved object preſents it ſelf to the imagination with ſome powerful charmes, as it happens in the firſt thoughts it hath of it, or when unawares it preſents it ſelf to the ſence, or when the minde figures new perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, and forms new deſigns to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the poſſeſſion thereof; for then the Soul being ſurpriſed with this lovely No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty is ſhaken all at once, and drives the Spirits like a great billow which ought to tranſport it to its offer'd good.</p>
                        <p>But what if Love moves the ſpirits thus, it muſt needs produce the ſame effects as joy doth; and that its violence muſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47499:50"/>quench the heat of the entrails and cauſe fainting and ſyncopes as this doth; it ſeems that even neceſſarily theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents muſt be in it, ſince theſe two paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have the ſame object, that they are but little ſeparate and that they have a growth alike; for where Love is, extreme joy ought alſo to be ſo: and yet none of thoſe ſymptomes whereof we have ſpoken have been obſerved to be in Love: at leaſt if any ſuch like thing hath happened to Lovers, the exceſs of thoſe two Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never was the cauſe; but it muſt have been Grief, Deſpair, and the like; how comes it to paſs then that the Love of beauty produceth not the ſame effects as Joy doth, or that Joy cauſeth not the ſame accidents in this Paſſion, which it often cauſeth alone?</p>
                        <p>To diſcover this ſecret, you muſt firſt ſuppoſe that theſe diſorders ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that they have been obſerveable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in old men and women; and that the joy which moved them was cauſed either by the gain of ſome unhoped for victory, or by the encounter of ſome very ridiculous object, or by the diſcovery of ſome great ſecret in learning, which are joyes which only belong to the minde: In effect, as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47499:50"/>ſpiritual things have that beyond corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that they are more noble and that they enter into the ſoul wholly without ſeparating themſelves; the poſſeſſion ought alſo to be more perfect and the joy the more raviſhing: ſo that it is likely, that the ſyncopes which are the effects of all violent Paſſions follow thoſe ſpiritual joyes as the greateſt and moſt powerful; and that they rather happen to weak na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then to thoſe which are ſtronger and more capable of reſiſtance: the ſoul then finding herſelf ſurpriſed at firſt ſight with theſe objects, and agitating with precipitation to unite her ſelf to them; the ſpirits which follow thoſe motions iſſue from the heart, and dart themſelves with ſo much violence to the ſuperior parts, that they loſe the union they had with their principle in the ſame manner as water divides it ſelf, being driven with too much impetuoſity; and becauſe the heat ought continually to inſpire the parts with its vertue; and that the ſpirits only can communicate it when they come to diſunite themſelves from it; theſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences muſt then ſtop, and the ſenſitive and vital actions which depend upon them, muſt alſo ceaſe till their reunion:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47499:51"/>And becauſe the ſoul is then quite raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the injoyment of that good which ſhe eſteems ſo excellent, ſhe cannot minde to remedy that interruption which is made in the ſpirits, nor to bring back thoſe which are ſcattered, or to ſend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to fill thoſe empty places they left. So that theſe faintings often laſt long, and ſometimes cauſe death; heat being quite periſhed, and nature not having ſtrength enough to repair its loſs, nor to recover its firſt eſtate.</p>
                        <p>But this diſorder cannot happen in the Love whereof we ſpeak; for that corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beauty is never wholly poſſeſt, and that there is ſtill ſomewhat which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines Deſire, Hope, and Fear: So that the ſoul dividing it ſelf to ſeveral deſigns, and ſuffering it ſelf not to be ſo powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſported as ſhe doth in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpiritual goods, the ſpirits throw themſelves not with ſo much precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor impetuoſity, and are not ſo ſubject to the diviſion which they ſometimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Joy; and which is the cauſe of thoſe ſyncopes of which we have ſpoken. We ſhall touch upon this matter again in other places; let's now conſider what heat it is which this Paſſion raiſeth, and what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47499:51"/>it particularly moves: Its certain that Love, Joy, and Deſire, diſperſe through all the body a moiſt and pleaſing heat, for as much as the ſpirits in thoſe Paſſions ſtir the moſt temperate humors whoſe vapors are ſweet and humid; but theſe humors are ſooner mov'd then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; becauſe that the ſpirits which have a great likeneſs with the pureſt and moſt ſubtil parts of the blood, as being thoſe whence they draw their origine, ought to mingle and unite with them more eaſily then with thoſe which are groſſer and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from its nature; &amp; therefore we muſt not doubt but when they are agitated they firſt of al draw along with them thoſe parts of the blood whereto they are more ſtrongly tyed, &amp; which being the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, are alſo the more eaſie to be moved: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the ſoul to whom the humors ſerve as inſtruments to arrive at the end ſhe propoſeth, employs both the one &amp; the other according as they have qualities ſit to execute what ſhe wills; whence it is that amongſt venemous beaſts it moves the venome in anger, and in all the reſt it moves flegme and melancholy, becauſe they are the malignant humors which may deſtroy the ill ſhe aſſaults: ſo that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47499:52"/>there being no enemies to combat in the Paſſion of which we ſpeak, it ought not to move any other humors but thoſe which are conformable to the good ſhe would enjoy; So that there is only the ſweeteſt and pureſt blood which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moves in Love, and cauſeth that ſweet and vaporous heat which diſperſeth it ſelf through the whole body.</p>

                        <head>PART. 4. <hi>What the cauſes are of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of</hi> LOVE.</head>
                        <p>BUt its time to come to the point we propoſed; from theſe principles we have eſtabliſhed, we muſt draw the cauſes of the Characters of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; let's firſt therefore examine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions.</p>
                        <p>There being no Paſſion which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſo many different actions, or cauſeth ſo many extravagancies as this, it would prove a troubleſome thing to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all, and beſides unprofitable, ſince the greateſt part of them proceed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſions which accompany it, of which we are particularly to ſpeak; for which cauſe we will only touch here the principal; which in my opinion are, <hi>The continual thought a Lover hath of the beloved Object, The high eſteem he values it at, The
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47499:53"/>means he imploys to poſſeſſe it, And the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy of the words he makes uſe of to diſcover his paſsion;</hi> for there are few actions in Love which may not be reduced to ſome of theſe four.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, although it be a thing common to all the Paſſions powerfully to poſſeſſe the minde, and to keep it fix'd on the object which entertains them; yet there are none who do it more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or longer then Love. For either they are impetuous or turbulent, or elſe they are pliable and docile; the firſt are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſſipated, and the others are to be appeaſed or diverted by the power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, nay even by other Paſſions. So the angry ones ſweeten themſelves by pleaſure, and the delightful diminiſh by affliction; and all of them may change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others more ſtrong, if more powerful objects then thoſe which have raiſed them preſent themſelves; for a great grief makes us forget a leſs, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of joy takes away a mean one: But with Love it is nothing ſo; it hath the propriety to be vehement and long laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not to hearken to reaſon, and can ſeldom be changed or diminiſhed by the force of what Paſſion ſoever; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47499:53"/>as the imagination is ſo wounded, that it fancies there is no greater good to be poſſeſt, and which can affoord it more contentment then its beloved object; ſo that there is no other, how excellent ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, that can divert its inclination and draw it to it, becauſe the ſoul never leaves a greater good to ſeek a leſs; 'tis in the ſame manner with diſpleaſure; for if we are beloved, there is no pain nor grief which vaniſheth not by the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we receive thereby; and if we are not, as the ſoul knows no greater ill then that, all others are too weak to diſpoſſeſs that thought; for which cauſe it continually conſiders the good whereof its deprived, it unceſſantly deſires it, and ſeeks in the poſſeſſion thereof the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which may cure all its diſpleaſures. But the firſt origine of all its effects is the powerful impreſſion which beauty makes in the minde; ſo that in making it appear how the objects of other Paſſions cannot make it ſo ſtrong and deep, it will alſo be manifeſt why its of a longer continuance, and why it keeps the minde more intent then any of the reſt.</p>
                        <p>Its a certain truth that there is a ſecret knowledge in us of thoſe things which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47499:54"/>ſerve for our preſervation; and its likely that this knowledge is gotten by means of ſome Idea's which nature hath imprinted in the bottom of the Soul, which being as it were hid and buried in its abyſſes, excite and ſtir up themſelves at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe which the ſences preſent, and ſo beget in the appetite Love, or Hate, Deſire or Averſion. Now as there are but two things which ſerve to preſerve us, the ſeeking of good, and the flying from evil; its evident nature inclines rather to ſeek good then to ſhun ill; and as there are alſo goods, which are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent &amp; profitable then others, ſhe hath a greater care of thoſe of higher, then of theſe of a lower value; &amp; ſhe forms a more exact Idea, and makes a ſtronger and more profoud impreſſion of them; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, you cannot doubt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſpecies being a more general and more excellent good then all others which reſpect only a particular good, but that it hath oblig'd nature to give the ſoul a more efficacious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; a more ardent deſire of that then of any other thing whatſoever; and but that conſequently ſhe hath powerfully imprinted the Idea of beauty, ſince its the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47499:54"/>mark which makes that good known, and that charme which excites the ſoul to its poſſeſſion: ſo that exterior beauty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the imagination, and meeting that general Idea which nature hath graven therein, unites it ſelf, therewith awakens and excites that ſecret and powerful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which accompanies it, and applyes it to the object it repreſents unto it; thence is that ſtrong attention which fixeth a Lovers minde on the perſon of the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and which cauſeth in him after the Love of ſilence and ſolitude the diſguſt of all other divertiſements which were moſt delightful to him, and all thoſe viſions which a ſolitary life inſpires in a ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated with Hope and Fear; in a word, wounded by the cruelleſt of all the Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>We are now to enquire the ſource of that high eſteem which we make of the beloved object; for from thence iſſue all the reſpects, the ſubmiſſions, the ſervices, and the greateſt part of the dialect which Lovers uſe: and truly its a ſtrange thing and almoſt incredible, were it not dayly obſerved, to ſee Kings ſubmit their crowns and their power to the beauty of a ſlave; the wiſeſt men to adore a vitious perſon,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47499:55"/>and the moſt couragious to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to baſe and feeble mindes worthy of nothing but contempt; whence can that powerful ſpell proceed which makes us loſe the knowledge of what we are, and of what we love, and makes us have ſo ill an opinion of our ſelves, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious a thought of what we love? we need not doubt but the imagination is the chief cauſe of this error: As it hath the power to enlarge the images it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, and to cloath them in the new fantaſmes which diſguiſe the things and make them appear quite otherwiſe then they are; it ſets on the image of that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is repreſented unto it, what it uſeth to do in dreams, or on a light Idea which it hath from the humor which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated, it forms a hundred ſeveral <hi>Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's,</hi> which have a conformity with that humor; for the imagination receiving the image of the beloved object, forms it ſelf on the model of that general Idea of beauty which nature hath imprinted in it, adorning it with the ſame graces ſhe confounds it therewith, and ſo makes the beloved perſon appear more perfect then in effect it is; and we may further ſay, that herein it happens as in the ſickneſs of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47499:55"/>the minde, where the particular er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which diſorders it changeth and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts all the thoughts which have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it, thoſe who are at diſtance from it remaining ſtill enough reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; foraſmuch as a Lover may preſerve his judgement free in thoſe things which do not concern the perſon beloved; but as ſoon as that is intereſted he becomes a ſlave to his paſſion, and judgeth of things according to that pleaſing error which it hath inſpired into him; in effect, its a wonder that a deformed face, and which we ſhould have judged ſuch, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appear full of attractives, as if the imagination had painted it, or at leaſt had blotted out all its defects: But the paint or the perfection it gives comes from that Idea wherewith its filled, and which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath affoorded to oblige it to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the greateſt good which can happen to it.</p>
                        <p>However it be, the ſoul being abuſed in the judgement it made of beauty, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for a moſt excellent good, whoſe poſſeſſion ought to render it more perfect, wholly ſubmits to it, and conſiders it no otherwiſe then as a Queen who is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it. For good hath that property
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47499:56"/>that it communicates it ſelf with Empire, and renders it ſelf maſter of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; foraſmuch as it is a perfection which is in ſtead of act and form, as the thing which receives it is in ſtead of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and matter. Now its a certain maxime that the form renders it ſelf maſter of the matter, otherwiſe it could not receive perfection.</p>
                        <p>And conſequently beauty muſt have that predominant quality that the ſoul which is touched with it muſt ſubject her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to its Empire; thence followes all thoſe ſubmiſſions and reſpects, all thoſe termes of ſervitude and of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity which are ſo common with Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; whence its eaſie to draw the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the principle we have eſtabliſhed; let's now examine the means Love hath invented to poſſeſs the good it tends to.</p>
                        <p>Although Love may ſubſiſt in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly union which the appetite makes with the Idea of the beloved object; we may further ſay, that this union and this Love are not perfect; Love ſtayes not there, but always ſeeks really to unite it ſelf, but by the communication of thoughts, and by the actual preſence which the ſences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47499:56"/>the ſoul in a manner going out of her ſelf by ſpeech, and the ſences ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for channels by which the objects flow into the imagination; ſo that the ſoul beleeves that by means of diſcourſe ſhe ſtrongly unites her ſelf to the beloved perſon, and that it unites it ſelf to the ſoul by means of the ſences: Whence it comes that Lovers wiſh they may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſee, hear, and entertain thoſe they love; even the kiſs wherein they place their higheſt felicities, hath no other end but to unite their ſoul to the beloved object.</p>
                        <p>So that only thoſe parts by which it ſeems moſt to communicate it ſelf, give and receive it; as the mouth becauſe its the door of the thoughts, the eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the channels through which the Paſſions iſſue out, and the hands becauſe they are the principal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of its actions: But amongſt all the means which nature hath taught us to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this perfect union, there is none more conſiderable then reciprocal Love; becauſe union ſuppoſing two things, the Lover, and the Object, to render it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, both the one and the other muſt really unite. Now if the beloved
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47499:57"/>object is capable of loving, it can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways unite it ſelf but by Love, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the ſoul unites it ſelf with things which are without it, only by that Paſſion: wherefore the firſt care of a Lover, is to make himſelf beloved, and to that end to render himſelf grateful; whence it happens conſequently that he accommodates himſelf to the inclinations of the perſon beloved, that he changeth his humor, his manner of living, that he growes liberal, curteous, neat, and in a word that he doth all what he thinks may make him be beloved.</p>
                        <p>We are now to enquire the cauſe of that extravagant manner of ſpeaking which is ſo particular to Lovers: In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral we may ſay, that the ſoul in that Paſſion carrying it ſelf out of its ſelf, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries alſo other things beyond what they are, and forms thoughts of them beyond the natural expreſſion they ſhould have; whence it is that the good and ill it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives is alwayes in exceſs; and if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing cannot ſuffer it, it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens it with ſome ſtrange Idea to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the meaning thereof, and ſo builds thoſe bold Metaphors which give to the beloved object the title of the faireſt and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47499:57"/>the nobleſt things in the world, which of a gentle heat cauſe a burning fire, of a mean diſquiet a torment and a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of a little ſubmiſſion which beauty requires a captivity, priſons, and chains, and ſo of the reſt; whereunto the error of the imagination contributes very much, which being wholly fill'd with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inſtinct which it hath from beauty, beleeves that there is no greater good, nor heavier ill then it expects from Love; ſo that it alwayes repreſents them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, and conſequently uſeth more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant termes then in any other Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſidering alſo that Lovers who commonly employ in their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but very few thoughts, and who are never weary to repeat them, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to diverſify the termes that they may be the leſs tedious; which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do but by many Metaphors, which at laſt become extravagant, being to ſeek to finde out reaſonable ones enough, for the variety they endeavor.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe general reaſons, there are yet particular ones for ſome words, which are always in the mouths of thoſe that love; and when they call the beloved perſon <hi>Their Heart, Their Soul,</hi> and <hi>Their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47499:58"/>Life;</hi> when they call them <hi>Ungrateful, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micides,</hi> and <hi>Cruel,</hi> and when they ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſay, <hi>They dye for Love:</hi> for although all theſe kinds of expreſſions ſeem extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, yet they come from a principle which in ſome ſort renders them true; foraſumch as Love keeping the Soul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtretched towards the beloved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and tranſporting it out of it ſelf to unite it thereto, ſeparates it alſo morally from the ſubject it animates, and in effect takes away from it the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and the cauſe of all that belongs to it: So that in that reſpect we may ſay, that it lives no more in him nor for him, being wholly in the beloved perſon; that a Lover hath reaſon to call her his <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>his Soul,</hi> ſince his deſires and thoughts which are the nobleſt parts of <hi>his life,</hi> are alone in her, and that its true that <hi>he dyes,</hi> nay even that <hi>he is dead,</hi> ſince that he no longer lives in himſelf. Now as there is but reciprocal Love only which can make them live again; foraſmuch as then the beloved perſon transforms herſelf in him, and communicates to him both ſoul and life; if he be unhappy to ſo high a degree that he cannot be loved, it ſeems that he hath cauſe to call her <hi>Ungrateful, Cruel,</hi>
                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:47499:58"/>and <hi>Murthereſs;</hi> ſince giving himſelf wholly to her alone, ſhe is oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſo high a liberality, and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating his ſoul from him ſhe kills him; and it is a cruelty to let him dye whoſe life ſhe may ſave. Its true, that to ſpeak really, we may ſay that there is but a very light ſhadow of truth in all theſe words, that the ſoul operates here as in a dream, and that Platonick Philoſophy which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd theſe viſions kept intelligence with this Paſſion, or would conſolate Lovers in the miſeries they ſuffered; let's leave her employed on ſo fair a deſigne, and ſeek the cauſes of the corporal Characters which we have deſcribed.</p>
                        <p>But we will not here examine whence that great diverſity comes which appears in this Paſſion, which makes it in ſome ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſportful or penſive, in others peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or turbulent; &amp; in a word, perhaps two perſons have never been found, in whom it hath bin altogether alike; for its evident that it comes from the divers inclinations which the temperature or cuſtome hath introduced into the ſoul, which draw the Paſſions to the bend they take, and makes them follow the ſame courſe which they are accuſtomed to; the mixture of other
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47499:59"/>Paſſions alſo contribute thereunto, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible that Love ſhould be frolick when its accompanied with Grief or Anger, or that it ſhould be ſevere when Hope or Joy are of the party: But all theſe diverſities are eaſie to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; let's now to our principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
                        <p>To follow the Method we have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, we are here to place two kinds of theſe Characters; ſome of which are done for ſome certain end, others which happen by a pure neceſſity; the firſt are made by the ſouls command, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them fit to execute her paſſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are often unprofitable as we have ſaid, the other are purely natural, and are made without deſign being only effects which by a neceſſary conſequence come from the trouble and the agitation which is inwardly made.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe of the firſt rank, are the motions of the eyes and forehead, the faultring of the tongue, the ſweetning and ſeveral falls of the voice, laughter, and the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the body; All the reſt are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural; as for the <hi>Motion of the eyes</hi> there are ſo many ſeveral kinds of it, that its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible to obſerve them: For as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47499:59"/>all the Paſſions may ſpring from Love, and ſuffer alſo with it, and every of them cauſing the eyes to move diverſly; It alſo happens that all their motions meet there: So that pleaſure makes them ſparkle, Deſire advanceth them forward, Grief caſts them down, Fear renders them unquiet, Reſpect inclines them, Deſpight kindles them, and ſo of the reſt; whoſe cauſes we will deduce in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of every Paſſion; all what we can herein do, is to enquire which are the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous eyes and looks,</hi> and what obligeth the Soul to uſe them by reaſon of the great difficulty there is both in the one and the other.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, there are ſome who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that amorous eyes are thoſe whoſe looks are quick and nimble, and which in a moment are caſt about on every ſide; foraſmuch as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaking of laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eyes which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſome Tranſlators have rendred <hi>Inſanos,</hi> which are properly thoſe wild eyes which are in perpetual motion; But beſides that they have not met with the ſence of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and that he would have intimated thoſe which he calls <hi>Devorantes,</hi> of which we are going to ſpeak; its certain that thoſe wild
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47499:60"/>eyes do not become Love, and are more proper for Anger, Diſquiet, and the Lightneſs of the minde then for this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Others think them to be thoſe whoſe balls lift up themſelves up on high, and half hide themſelves under their lids, which are the dying eyes, becauſe thoſe who die commonly have them ſo, as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> has obſerved in his Problems, where he adds, that it alſo happens in ſome actions of Love: But at that time the ſoul hath no deſigne to cauſe that motion and 'tis purely a natural effect which followes the exceſs of pleaſure, as we will ſay in its due place; for otherwiſe thoſe kinde of looks are marks of Grief and Langour; we might even alſo ſay, that they are thoſe urgent looks by which the eyes ſeem to throw themſelves on their objects, and as if they would as they ſay devour them, which the Latins ſo happily name <hi>Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Procaces, Devorantes,</hi> but we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid that they were bred from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and not from Love.</p>
                        <p>For my part, I beleeve that the eyes in queſtion, are thoſe which the Latins call <hi>Paetos,</hi> and which for the ſame reaſon they have given to <hi>Venus;</hi> for they are ſmiling, and ſend forth their looks as it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47499:60"/>were by ſtealth, the lids ſweetly inclining and half ſhutting themſelves. In effect, there are none which have ſo much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency with the nature of Love as theſe have; foraſmuch as in one look they make known all the principal motions which are to be found in this Paſſion: for we have made it appear, that Love chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſted in the interior union of the appetite with the beloved object; That pleaſure always accompanied it, That Beauty inſpired ſubmiſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; That to Love was nothing but to dye, and that if a Lover poſſeſs not the beloved perſon, Deſire inceſſantly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited him: Now the look whereof we have ſpoken makes all theſe motions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for laughter is an effect of joy; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and ſubmiſſion inclines the lids; the ball which ſweetly turns towards the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object is a ſigne of that amorous languor whereof the ſoul is ſenſible; and the looks it darts on it, witneſs the Deſire which provokes it: In fine although the eyes half ſhut themſelves, laughter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the muſcles of the lids, yet we may ſay, that they ſhut themſelves ſo, as if the ſoul would retain the image it newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the more attentively to conſider
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47499:61"/>it and even that it would quite ſhut them up, had it not a new one which every moment preſented it ſelf, and which it would not loſe, but which obligeth it ſo to divide its cares, as it often doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Fear and Anger, where it ſeems as if at the ſame time it would ſee and not ſee the ill, which it either flees or diſdains.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Forehead</hi> in love is always clear and laughing, and ſeems as if it opened and extended it ſelf, which is a mark of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: ſo that the Dog, which is a flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature, hath his always ſo, when he careſſeth any one, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> will have it. Now the word <hi>Flattery</hi> ſignifies nothing elſe here, but complacencie and dearneſs, and not that vice which is the peſt of the Court, and of Friendſhip. You need not then wonder if Love, being complacent and flattering, diſpoſeth thus the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. But the firſt cauſe of this effect, is the Joy which accompanieth all theſe Paſſions; whoſe property it is, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the countenance open, calm, and ſmiling, as in its place we will declare.</p>
                        <p>Let us paſs to another effect, the cauſe whereof is extremely hid; 't is the <hi>Motion of the Tongue,</hi> which often trembles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lips, and ſeems even to tickle
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47499:61"/>them. Now this happens in a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Love; whether it be, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor which this Paſſion kindles, dries the lips, and obligeth the Soul to moiſten them; or that the Spirits, which ſparkle everywhere, cauſe the ſame agitation in that part, which appears in all the reſt of thoſe which are very moveable: or, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether it comes from the vehemency of the Deſire: for the ſame effect often happens to thoſe who ſee another eat what they ardently deſire: And it ſeems alſo more befitting the appetite for meat, then any other deſire whatſoever, as well as that humidity which comes in ones mouth, as ſhall be ſaid; becauſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tongue, and the humour in which it moiſtens it ſelf, ſerves to raſte the aliments, and to convey them into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. But as the Soul hath no diſtinct knowledge of what it doth, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Paſſion troubles and diſtracts it, it alſo happens that it employs the means neceſſary for one deſigne, in another where they are uſeleſs; and ſo doth in the deſire of Beauty, what it ought onely to do in that of Aliments.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſweetning of the voice</hi> ſignifies the reſpect and ſubmiſſion of a Lover: and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47499:62"/>although it be a neceſſary effect of Fear, which, ſtraitning the paſſages, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of the Lungs more looſe, makes the voice ſoft, ſweet, and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even very often without any ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; the ſoul hath a deſigne to form it ſo, to witneſs its modeſtie and reſpect; knowing, that a ſtrong and vehement voice is an effect of Boldneſs; and that that which is rude and ſharp, follows a harſh humour; which are qualities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with Love, and which a Lover muſt hide, if Nature or Cuſtom have given him them.</p>
                        <p>As for what concerns all <hi>the inflexions of the voice,</hi> they proceed from the ſeveral motions which agitate the Soul; whether it be that admiration raviſh it, or grief op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it; whether deſire tranſport it, or that ſome difficulties oppoſe its content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: foraſmuch as in all theſe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it burdens the voice with particular accents, ſometimes raiſing it with excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, ſometimes letting it fall with languiſhings; ſometimes cutting it ſhort, and ſometimes drawing it out, according to the nature of the Paſſions it ſuffers.</p>
                        <p>Laughter, being an effect of Joy, is to be examined in that Paſſion, where we
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47499:62"/>will at large ſpeak of its nature, and of its cauſes. So that we have nothing but the <hi>Geſture</hi> and the <hi>Behaviour</hi> which ſeem to detain us. But, if you obſerve it, there is none particular to love; and that which is there obſervable, and is ſo changeable, follows the ſeveral Paſſions which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this: for, ſometimes Reſpect renders him modeſt, Joy and Fear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet him, and Sorrow caſts him down, and makes him languiſh; ſometimes a Lover is in the poſture of a ſuppliant, or a contented, or of a deſperate man; ſometimes he walks faſt, ſlowe, or ſtands ſtill, according as Deſire, Aſtoniſhment or Grief poſſeſs him. So that all his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions going with the ſpring of other Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we are not here obliged to their exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but we muſt remit it to the diſcourſe we will make of every one in particular. Now let us to that of thoſe Characters which are purely natural and neceſſary, and wherein it ſeems the Soul hath no ſhare.</p>
                        <p>The eyes are <hi>ſparkling</hi> in Love, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the quantity of ſpirits which flie thither: for it is not to be doubted, but that from them it is, that that reſplendent vivacity comes, which is ſo viſible in them,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47499:63"/>ſince they loſe it when they retire or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe themſelves; as it happens to thoſe who are poſſeſt with fear, or who die. But what addes to augment this luſtre w<hi rend="sup">eh</hi> appears in the eyes, 'tis, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane which in virons them, being ſwelled and extended by the confluence of thoſe vapours and ſpirits, becomes more ſmoothe, and conſequently more ſhining; and that there is ſtill over it a certain humidity, where light reſplends and ſparkles.</p>
                        <p>But whence proceeds this <hi>Humidity?</hi> Is it not that the heat and agitation which the ſpirits cauſe in the brain, liquifies and makes the humours flow over the eyes? for even Tears are ſo cauſed in Joy: Or rather, that thoſe ſubtil vapours of blood, which the Soul drives with impetuoſity, flie out, and preſently thicken, by reaſon of the coldneſs of the air, and of the Membranes. And indeed, here the eyes are hollow and ſunk, though they ſtill ſeem great and humid; which would not be, if this humidity came from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which fall from the brain; for they would fill the parts which are all about the eye, and would keep it lifted up: And therefore this humidity muſt come
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47499:63"/>from within, and the muſcles and fleſhie parts which inviron it muſt ſhrink: for as their ſubſtance is ſoft, and is made of a very ſubtil blood, it falls and diſſolves preſently; whence it happens, that the eye ſinks: but its body remains ſtill full, moiſt, and ſparkling, by reaſon of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and ſpirits which inceſſantly gather there: Unleſs it be at laſt, when the long continuance of the Malady, Grief, and Deſpair, have quenched the natural heat, which makes the eyes loſe their ſplendor and vivacity, and become obſcure, dry, and ſet; as we will ſhew in the Chapter of Grief, where we will alſo give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for Tears which are ſo common to Lovers.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>redneſs</hi> which love ſo often makes appear on the forehead, hath a cauſe to be diſcovered, of no ſmall difficulty: For although it be eaſie to ſay, that the blood riſeth into the face in all thoſe Paſſions wherein the ſoul drives out the ſpirits, yet there are thoſe which carry it rather to one place then to another: The red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which Choler excites, begins by the eyes; that of Shame, by the extremities of the cheeks and ears; and that of Love, by the forehead. And 'tis from this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47499:64"/>that the cauſe of this effect is moſt difficult to be found out. Yet I think that we may ſay, for what concerns Anger, that the eyes being the firſt wherein the Paſſions appear, are alſo the firſt ſenſible of the motions of the Spirits. Now as the blood boils in Anger, and as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt which agitates it drives it with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confuſion to the exteriour parts, thence it comes that the ſpirits which run to the eyes draw along with it the waves of this agitated blood, which ſwells their veins, and makes them appear red, in ſtead that in other Paſſions they carry with them the pureſt and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til parts of the blood, which cannot cauſe this effect. And it is therefore true, that Anger cauſeth redneſs to ariſe in the face ſooner then any other Paſſion, and that it begins to diſcover it in the eyes, becauſe the blood follows the ſpirits, which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that place rather then in any other. As for Shame, you muſt know, that the Soul, which is moved therewith, at the ſame time forms a deſigne both to reſiſt and flee the ill; and we may ſay, that, fleeing, ſhe aſſaults it; for which cauſe, it forceth the blood to the face to drive it away; but Fear at the ſame time makes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47499:64"/>it retire back; whence it happens, that the extremities of the cheeks and ears grow red, as in its place ſhall be more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply diſcourſed. Let us now examine the redneſs which Love brings into the Forehead. Should it not proceed from Joy, wherein the ſpirits, after having united themſelves to the good which the ſoul conceives, overflow the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts? For, if it be ſo, the forehead muſt firſt reſent it. Or elſe the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being placed in the fore-part of the brain, that part is heated by the continual agitation of the ſpirits, and, after its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, communicates it to the forehead, wherewith, as Phyſick teacheth, it hath a great ſympathy. And indeed, ſince pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which appears in the reſt of the face, happens often from the tranſport of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the brain, its very likely, either that there is a reflux made on the neereſt parts, or that they are ſenſible of the heat which they there cauſe: whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that they are leſs pale and wan then the reſt. Now although this redneſs be particular to Love, that of other Paſſions forbears not to encounter therewith; and it may happen, that a Lover may bluſh for Shame, for Anger, for Joy, or Deſire,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47499:65"/>according as thoſe Paſſions mixe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this; but this is no place to ſpeake of them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>lips</hi> are often red and moyſt by the arrival of the vaporous blood which ſheds it ſelf in the face, and which ſo eaſily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours thoſe parts, by reaſon of their ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the delicacy of their skin; and this chiefly happens at the beginning of thoſe motions which are ſo frequent in this paſſion; for at laſt thoſe parts grow dry and pale, whether the heat conſume the ſweeteſt and moſt ſubtil parts of the blood, or that the ſpirits in their retreat carry them back again inwardly, and ſo leave paleneſs and drineſs on the lips.</p>
                        <p>But whence chanceth it that <hi>the under lip</hi> ſometimes trembles; you muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it an effect of Fear or of Anger, ſince it happens in the higheſt heat of Love; its then very likely that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which the Deſire drives in a crowd, ſparkle in thoſe places, and cauſe that part which is very moveable, and without that ſupport which the reſt have, to ſhake, and 'tis in that encounter that it ſometimes <hi>grows white</hi> with a ſubtil foam, the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity which riſeth in the mouth, and which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47499:65"/>ſheds it ſelf on the lips being agitated by theſe ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>tongue faulters,</hi> becauſe that the ſoul which is diſtracted with Paſſion thinks not upon the words it is to form, and retires the ſpirits which ſhould ſerve for that action to thoſe places where ſhe is employed; whence it happens that the tongue ſtops or looſly moves it ſelf, and that infirmity looſeth the ſpeech, or if we do ſpeak, it is with pain and ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, whereto the quantity of humors alſo contributes, which through Deſire fill the mouth; for it hinders that the tongue cannot ſo eaſily turn it ſelf, and that it ſtrikes not the voice clearly; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the diſtraction we now ſpeak of, is alſo a cauſe that Lovers hear not half what others ſay, and that their diſcourſe is commonly confuſed &amp; extravagant: Even the <hi>ſighs</hi> wh<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> every moment cut one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, owe their firſt original to that great attention of ſpirit which diverts the ſoul, and makes it loſe the remembrance of the moſt neceſſary actions of life; for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſpirits enough to cauſe reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the lungs beat but ſlowly, and the heart draws not that help which is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their ſervice; foraſmuch as they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47499:66"/>furniſh not it ſufficiently with air to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that fire which this Paſſion kindles, and that they diſcharge it not often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of thoſe fumes and vapors which the agitation of the humors raiſeth there: Now after this diſorder hath continued ſome time, and that at laſt it might ruine all the natural ceonomy, the ſoul being urged by neceſſity awakes again, and ſeeks to ſupply its defect by theſe great and extraordinary reſpirations; and indeed ſighs are principally begot at the iſſue out of ſome thought which hath forcibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the minde, and not whilſt it was employed therein.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>face</hi> grows <hi>pale,</hi> whether it be that the ſpirits retire within the brain as we have already ſaid, or becauſe that in the progreſs of this Paſſion the ſtomack grows weak and the blood changeth; for ſince that the diverſion of the ſpirits diverts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the heat &amp; vertue which ought to paſs into the ſtomack to cauſe digeſtion, you muſt not wonder if it become languiſhing, if the aliments change into crudities, and if the blood it makes be impure, ſince that the laſt concoction corrects not the defects of the former.</p>
                        <p>But what helps forward this diſorder,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47499:66"/>is the continual ardor which this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on kindles in the blood, and the ſeveral agitations which Fear, Grief, and Anger, at every moment excite; for that diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates the ſpirits and makes the faculties become languiſhing, and the humors enflame and corrupt themſelves, which at laſt grows to that Erotick ſickneſs which the Phyſitians place in the ranck of folly and fury. The blood being then in this condition retains no more nether its vertue nor its natural colour; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes uſeleſs to the nouriſhment of the parts and no longer communicates that pleaſing vermillion which formerly it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, and ſo they muſt needs become pale, lean, and withered.</p>
                        <p>By the ſame reaſon the <hi>appetite is loſt,</hi> becauſe that the beloved object occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the thoughts of the Soul, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way its care of all the functions of Life; the ſpirits being alſo diverted no longer bear into the ſtomack that ſentiment which cauſeth the appetite: In fine, the diſorder which is in the humors, and in all the natural parts, hinders this from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming its function.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sleep</hi> being the reſt of common ſence, &amp; of the ſpirits, ſeldom happens in violent
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47499:67"/>Paſſions, detaining the Soul and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a continual agitation; but Love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures it leſs then the reſt, becauſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the tempeſt it raiſeth, it at laſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the blood, whoſe vapours are ſharp, and which conſequently want that ſweet humidity which Iulleth the Senſes.</p>
                        <p>Its true, that langour and wearineſs ſometimes procure it, becauſe the ſoul knows that life cannot ſubſiſt without it, and that after ſo great a diſſipation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits its neceſſary to repair them, to which end it gathers them together and ſtays them; For although this moiſt vapor which commonly provokes ſleep happen not here, as we ſaid but now, yet muſt we not beleeve that ſleep can come by no other means; it hath two ordinary and natural cauſes; the vapor which ſtops the paſſage of the ſpirits, and the ſoul which binds and ſtays them; now here being no vapor to produce this effect, neceſſity obligeth the ſoul to labour it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of her ſelf.</p>
                        <p>But this ſleep is interrupted with <hi>dreams</hi> which continually agitate the minde; foraſmuch as the imagination which in that condition loſeth not the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of working, and being full of thoſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47499:67"/>images which Paſſion ſuggeſts, turns over continually, confounds and augments them, ſo that they always preſent to it things greater then in effect they are, and afterwards form in the appetite more powerful motions then the true objects would do.</p>
                        <p>The remembrance or the unexpected arrival of the beloved party ſwels the heart and the pulſe, becauſe the ſoul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the organs to receive the good, and to ſend forth ſpirits to its encounter; a great difficulty upon this occaſion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to wit, whether <hi>Love have a kind of pulſe proper to it alone?</hi> for that ſome have vaunted the diſcovery of this Paſſion by the beating of the arteries: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtopping at the conteſts which are formed hereupon, we will boldly ſay that there is no more reaſon to give one which is proper to Anger, and to Grief, then to Love. That the heart can no leſs reſent the motion which this Paſſion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the appetite then it can that which the others excite; and that the organs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conformably to the intention of the minde, this part muſt be otherwiſe agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in Love then in other paſſions, ſince it hath a diffent deſigne from what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47499:68"/>have. Its true, its hard exactly to diſcover this difference, becauſe men have made no juſt obſervation thereof, and perhaps it is impoſſible to make it; for that the heart is ſhut up in the Center of the Body, and that it ſuffers motions, which it communicates not with the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yet amongſt ſuch kinds of pulſes as have been obſerved, we may yet find ſome one which particularly belongs to Love. To underſtand this, you muſt know that the heart hath many motions which are common to ſeveral Paſſions; for it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it ſelf in Joy, in Hope, and in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and contracts it ſelf in Grief, and in Fear, and in Deſpair; in ſome it goes quick and with violence, in others ſlow and languiſhing, and its certain theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral differences cannot all alone mark thoſe which are proper to every Paſſion; but as Phyſick teacheth us that there are twenty kinds of ſimple pulſes, and that they may diverſly mix the one with the other, every Paſſion may finde in this great variety, that kind which is proper to it: thus the pulſe of Anger is not only great and lifted up, or quick, or frequent, or vehement, but it is compoſed of all theſe differences: That of Fear is quick,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47499:68"/>hard, unequal, and irregular; That of Joy is great, rare and ſlow; That of Grief is weak little ſlow and rare; and as they ſay, theſe are the kindes of pulſes which are proper to theſe Paſſions, we may alſo obſerve in the ſame manner one proper to Love; and indeed therein the beating of the arteries is great, large, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, and irregular; it is great and large, becauſe the heart opens to receive the good which preſents it ſelf as was before ſaid; it is unequal and irregular, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſeveral Paſſions with which this is continually traverſed; for as we do not here ſpeak of that ſimple and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Love which is yet but in the ſoul; but of that which is compleat and finiſhed and which hath already made impreſſions on the body; it is impoſſible but Deſire, and Fear, Joy, and Grief, ſhould at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment confound themſelves with it, whence conſequently happens the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal motion of the heart and of the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and this is chiefly to be obſerved at the remembrance or unexpected arrival of the beloved perſon.</p>
                        <p>For after this firſt elevation which is made at this encounter, it changeth a hundred wayes; it appears little and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47499:69"/>and immediately returns to its firſt vehemency; from ſwift and light, it becomes ſlow and heavy, and all at once it reaſſumes its firſt quickneſs, which it loſeth again in an inſtant, and paſſeth thus from one difference to another, without order and without proportion.</p>
                        <p>There are but very few Characters which remain to be examined, whoſe cauſes are not very evident; For the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet</hi> comes from the divers agitations which the ſoul feels; the <hi>ſhiverings</hi> and <hi>the ardors</hi> follow the flowing and ebbing of the Spirits; forasmuch as Fear and Grief, which retire them within, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the exterior parts the heat they had, even as Joy and Hope reſtore and augment it, and as Boldneſs and Anger ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſpirits together, ſtrength alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, as it diminiſheth when Joy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipates, or Grief ſtiffles them: There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines no more difficulties to be found but in the <hi>Syncopes</hi> and <hi>Extaſies</hi> which ſometimes happen to Lovers; but we have already ſhewed that Love could not alone cauſe Syncopes nor faintings, but that it muſt be Grief, Deſpair, or Joy.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Extaſie</hi> its true it may proceed from Love, yet we muſt obſerve that the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47499:69"/>word hath divers ſignifications; the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians often take it for an extreme alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſpirit, ſuch as thoſe have who are frantick or mad; ſometimes for that ſtrange diſeaſe which they call <hi>Catoche,</hi> which all at once takes away the uſe of ſence and motion, and keeps the body ſtiffe in the ſame poſture in which it ſurpriſed it; there are ſome who beleeve that the true <hi>Extaſie</hi> is made when the ſoul doth no action in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether it dwell there, or that indeed it iſſue forth for a time; as it happens in thoſe which are poſſeſt, and in thoſe who are raviſhed by the ſpirit of God; but that whereof we ſpeak is nothing elſe but a certain raviſhment of the ſoul, which takes from the body the uſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ſence and motion, the imagination and the underſtanding not forbearing to operate, which happens by a ſtrong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which binds the ſoul to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object, which makes it loſe the care of all animal functions, and which imploying all the ſpirits in that thought, hinders them from flowing to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of ſence and motion; and this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment may ſometimes Paſs to ſuch an exceſs that the vital faculties may
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47499:70"/>receive no more influence from the ſoul, ſo that reſpiration will ceaſe, and that there will be onley natural vertue to ſuſtain life.</p>

                        <head>PART. 5. <hi>Of the nature of Beauty in general; and why it begets</hi> LOVE.</head>
                        <p>ALthough the Senſes were given to the Minde, to help it to know things, yet it ſeems that thoſe things which are the moſt ſenſible, are the leaſt known: And I know not whether it be a grace, or an artifice of Nature, to bring thoſe things neereſt our Senſes, which ought to be furtheſt from our Mindes; and, by that exteriour know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to recompenſe the little progreſs we might make in that which was true and eſſential. However it be, its moſt evident, that we are ſenſible of nothing in the world more then of Beauty, nor nothing is more difficult to be known: the greateſt men, who have been moſt ſenſible of its effects, were ignorant of the Cauſes thereof; and we may ſay, that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47499:71"/>it hath made them loſe their Reaſon, when they were but touched with it, and would have diſcourſed of it: For, ſome have ſaid that it was a juſt proportion of the parts; others, that it was the form of things; in fine, that it was the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and glittering of Goodneſs it ſelf: But this laſt definition is equivocal, and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical; and the other cannot be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but to the Divine beauty, which is the ſource and model of all Beauties; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as in the Unity and infinite Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of God, there can be no proportion or form.</p>
                        <p>That we may therefore ſteer a more certain courſe then what hitherto hath been followed, and that we may not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſo vaſt and difficult a matter; we muſt conſider, that things are not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fair, but as they fall under a very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and exact knowledge: So that there are only the objects of the Underſtanding, and of Seeing, and of Hearing, to which we allow Beauty; becauſe that all the Knowing faculties are thoſe which moſt perfectly judge of their objects, and are the leaſt miſtaken in them: And theſe ſame objects which we judge Fair, are alſo eſteemed Good: for we do not onely
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47499:71"/>ſay, A fair minde, a fair ſpeech, or a fair colour, but they may be alſo called good. But the objects of the other Senſes, and all the other powers, may onely be ſtiled Good, and can never deſerve the title of Fair: for, it were a ridiculous thing to ſay, that heat or humidity, ſweetneſs or bitterneſs were fair: Whence we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that all what is Good, is not Fair; but all that is Fair, is good; and therefore, that Fair is a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Good. Now as Good is not good, but as it is agreeable; the Fair, ſince it is good, muſt be agreeable to ſomething; and therefore if what is fair ſerve but for an object onely to the knowing facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that Fair is <hi>that which is agreeable to the intelligent faculties,</hi> as good is agreeable to what ever it be. Now becauſe Knowledge hath no other object, but the eſſence and the truth of things, Beauty muſt needs be of that kinde; and the objects muſt be the fairer, where the eſſence and the truth are beſt expreſt: for which cauſe, Souls are fairer then Bodies; and the Underſtanding, which knows interiour things, is more capable to judge of Beauty then the Senſes, which know onely the exteriour.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47499:72"/>Whence it alſo happens, that Beaſts are ſeldom moved by Beauty, becauſe Senſe onely works in them; in ſtead that in Man the Underſtanding concurs to his action, and penetrates further into the Nature and Eſſence of its objects. And we experiment in our ſelves, that thoſe things which we do not greatly heed, and whoſe nature we do not well know, ſeem leſs fair unto us; and that its onely for Maſters in an Art to judge of the beauty of a work, becauſe they alone have the true knowledge thereof.</p>
                        <p>We do not therefore ſay, that Beauty conſiſts in Knowledge onely: for it would then follow, that things would not be fair until they are known; although it be moſt true, that God would not ceaſe to be infinitely fair, although he were not known. And there are things whoſe knowledge is equally clear and certain, which are not equally fair: for, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding diſtinguiſheth the Natures as more or leſs perfect, in the ſame manner as the eyes and ears judge that there are Colours and Harmonies the one fairer then the other. Now as things are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not by reaſon of our ſenſibleneſs, but becauſe they can make themſelves ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47499:72"/>and as the eſſence is not good, in that it communicates it ſelf, but in that it can communicate it ſelf: ſo Goodneſs is not fair becauſe it is known, but becauſe it may be known. So that Beauty is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Goodneſs in that order and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential relation it hath to Knowledge; that is to ſay, that it can communicate it ſelf to the intelligent faculties. And, in my judgement, we are ſo to underſtand <hi>Plato,</hi> when he ſays, that Beauty is a glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and ſplendor of Goodneſs: for as the brightneſs of light is that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it viſible; the brightneſs of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is that alſo which makes it known; and this brightneſs is no other but the act whereby goodneſs reſplends, enlightens, and communicates it ſelf to the knowing faculties. Now becauſe there are two kindes of faculties, the Intellectual and the Senſitive, there muſt alſo be two kindes of <hi>Beauty,</hi> the one <hi>intelligible,</hi> the other <hi>ſenſible:</hi> And becauſe that in either kinde there are ſubjects which are fairer and more excellent ſome then other ſome, we muſt, on the foundation we have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, obſerve the cauſe of this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is true, it requires a higher medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and a longer diſcourſe then our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47499:73"/>will permit: but we will onely touch on the principal, and on what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to underſtand what we ſhall ſay in conſequence of Humane Beauty.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſe then that Beauty is but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Goodneſs, ſo far as it hath a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the knowing faculties; and that Goodneſs is nothing, alſo, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perfection of things, ſo far as it can communicate it ſelf, as the School teacheth: thoſe things which have more of being and of eſſence, muſt be better, fairer, and more perfect: And we know they have more of being, when they have more unity; and, in that unity, they have more power and different vertues. So God hath an infinite perfection, becauſe that in a moſt perfect and moſt ſimple uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he hath a power to do all things. The intelligences, which are the moſt ſimple and the moſt active of all creatures, are alſo the moſt excellent. Even amongſt Bodies, the mixt are more perfect then the ſimple whereof they are compoſed: the Animate more then the Natural; and thoſe which have a Reaſonable ſoul, more then thoſe which are onely Senſitive; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in compariſon of thoſe, they have more different vertues, and more
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47499:73"/>actions, and therefore divers degrees more of eſſence. Thus much for what concerns Intelligible Beauty. But in Senſible objects, the perfection is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conſidered, as in that: it muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not onely from the being they have, but alſo from the organs of the Senſes which receives them, and from the fitneſs they ought to have with the bodies where they appear. So the Light, which is moſt reſplendent, is more perfect then all Colours; but, in reſpect of the eyes, Green is more, although even that colour is diſpleaſing in ſome ſubjects. Now the cauſe of this diverſity firſt of all comes, for that the Senſes having been given to creatures for their preſervation, they muſt not deſtroy them. And as their action is performed by the impreſſion which the objects make on their organs, if this impreſſion is not proportionable to them, their action will be imperfect: So that it ought to be ſtrong enough to give knowledge of the thing, but not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as to corrupt the organs. Whence it is, that the Senſes cannot judge well of their objects in their extremity; as the eyes of too great a light, or of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the ears of a too violent ſound, or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47499:74"/>of ſilence: And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that neither of them are ſenſible, becauſe that this makes no true impreſſion, and that the other deſtroys the organ. So that there are onely thoſe objects which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both extremities, which can make a juſt impreſſion proportionable to what the Senſes require. It is not therefore that all the objects equally touch the Senſes; there are ſome amongſt them which are more perfect, and more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then the reſt: Green is fairer then Grey or Black; the Eighth in Harmony is ſweeter then the Fourth: But the cauſe of this difference is extremely obſcure; yet if you obſerve what we have ſaid of the perfection of Intelligible things, you will finde that it depends from the ſame principle.</p>
                        <p>For it is certain, that Colours and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies have their beauty from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion they have; and thoſe which have it the moſt perfect, are alſo the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. Now proportions have the more perfection, the neerer they are to unity, and the more they are in that unity compoſed. So the Diapaſon, which is the moſt pleaſing of all ſimple harmonies, is made in a double proportion, to wit, of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47499:74"/>two to one, which is the moſt perfect of all ſimple proportions, becauſe it is neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the unity, nothing being neerer unity then the number of Two; and is the moſt compoſed: for, what is twice as much more, is more compoſed then that which is but once and a half, or once and a third part, as the other proportions, which are the Diapente and the Diateſſaron. It is the ſame with Colours: for, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which make perfect harmonies, make alſo, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, fair colours. For which cauſe, Green, which is the moſt agreeable of all others, is to be in the ſame proportion with the Diapaſon; and that of Blue and Purple with that of Diapente and Diateſſaron. But ſeeing we have examined theſe things in their place, it ſufficeth to ſhew, that Beauty, and the perfection of Senſible things, is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the ſame principle as that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible things, to wit, in that they have more unity, and that in this unity they have more powers; in a word, from that they have more of a ſenſible being.</p>
                        <p>It is eaſie, by this Diſcourſe, to perceive, that Light, conſidered as in it ſelf, is the faireſt thing which can be preſented to our ſight; but that Green, in reſpect of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47499:75"/>the organs, is yet more pleaſing then it. It remains onely to diſcover why this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour renders not all thoſe Bodies fair wherein it is. To this end, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that things work not but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the powers they have, and that theſe powers follow onely the degrees of their being. Now as there are things which cannot work without matter, it is evident this matter ought to be fitted and proportioned to their actions and their powers; and this proportion makes <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Beauty,</hi> which is nothing but <hi>a juſt joyning together of all the diſpoſitions which are neceſſary for bodies to perform thoſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions whereto they are ordained:</hi> So that all the material qualities, how excellent ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be, will render the ſubjects wherein they are, deformed, if they are not proportionable to the eſſence, and to the interiour vertue which they have. So the Round figure, which is the moſt perfect of all, becauſe it is the ſimpleſt, and comprehends all the reſt, cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate it ſelf with the actions of all the parts of the humane body, which would be monſtrous and horrible, had it onely that figure. It is the ſame of the faireſt Colours, which have no conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47499:75"/>with the temperature of Man, and which would make an extreme change ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the humours, if they were viſible in the face. The tone even of the voice, which in men ought to be ſtronger and more reſounding, were a defect in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, becauſe it is not conformable to her temper, which ought to be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the natural power of her ſex. This is then the reaſon which ſhews, that the beauty of Senſible objects is drawn, not onely from their abſolute being, and from the relation which they have with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, but alſo the connexion which they ought to have with their ſubjects.</p>
                        <p>I ſpeak not now of the particular ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we may have of Beauty, nor why Red is more eſteemed then Green, the Brown hue more then the Vermilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Blue eyes more then Black: We have no room here for the examination of theſe things; we do but touch on ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; and we think we have ſatisfied our deſigne, when we have ſaid ſomewhat more of Humane Beauty, becauſe it is that which cauſeth the Love whereof we ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>There are ſeveral ſorts or divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Beauty in Man: For firſt, there
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47499:76"/>is the Intelligible, which is eſſential, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental: the Eſſential is conſidered in the Species, or in the Sex; the Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the Habit, and in the Actions. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is a Senſible and Corporal Beauty.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of this is, becauſe the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of every animal hath its beauty in it, which is nothing but its being and its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, wherein are compriſed all the powers and vertues due unto it. But becauſe that amongſt theſe powers there are ſome which are deſtined for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Species, which would be loſt with the life of the creatures, had not God given them the vertue to ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their like; and that generation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, unleſs there alſo be an active and a paſſive power: it was neceſſary that there ſhould be two Sexes, between which theſe two powers ſhould be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And foraſmuch as Senſible beauty is nothing but an aſſembling together of all corporal diſpoſitions neceſſary for the powers to perform their functions, every Sex muſt alſo neceſſarily have different diſpoſitions, ſince they have different powers: And thence is the ſource whence the difference comes of Male and Female<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beauty,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47499:76"/>which is not onely to be found in ſome parts, but in the whole body: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt qualities being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal diſpoſitions of theſe two powers; and heat and drineſs, which amongſt them are the moſt working, being obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the active power, as cold and humidity the paſſive power: it muſt needs be, that all the maſs of humours muſt taſte of theſe qualities: So that the temperature of the Male being hot and dry, and that of the Female cold and moiſt, it follows that all the parts of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex ought to have different diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and beauties.</p>
                        <p>But foraſmuch as Man hath Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Reaſon beyond all other creatures, and that that faculty, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally capable of all things, cannot have its perfection, but by poſſeſſing them, it muſt acquire diſpoſitions neceſſary to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this perfection; and theſe are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and Moral habits, which cauſe that accidental and acquired Beauty of which we have ſpoken, and which receive their laſt accompliſhment in the actions they ought to produce: for, the end is the laſt perfection, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abſolutely perfect without an
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47499:77"/>end; and Action being the end of all things.</p>
                        <p>This is what we can ſay in general of the Name of Beauty, and muſt be known, before we ſeek the cauſe which obligeth us to the love thereof: For although ſome have ſaid, we ſhould not aſk, why Beauty pleaſeth, and that it was as much as if we would know why Fire warms, That it is its Nature, and the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential propertie it hath, whereof there is no reaſon to be given; yet all have not been of this opinion: <hi>Plato</hi> did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this enquiry was unworthy of his <hi>Socrates:</hi> And there is no body who doth not freely confeſs, that if the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be attained, it muſt needs be very rare and excellent. Now although I do not altogether diſapprove this thought of <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſays that the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of created things raviſheth us, becauſe it is a ray and an image of the Divine beauty, which, being Soveraignly good, neceſſarily inſpires love, when it makes it ſelf known: yet, as there are ſeveral things to be ſuppoſed in this opinion which the School of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and that at laſt we muſt always come to that, To know wherefore the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47499:77"/>Goodneſs is amiable; we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take another way, which may lead us to theſe Supreme truths.</p>
                        <p>We muſt then ſay, that what is good and convenient to a thing, perfects it; for it addes what it wanted, and in ſome manner alſo augments its being, giving it what it had not, and uniting what was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. And this is the foundation of all the inclinations which are to be found in Nature, and of the love we have for all that is truly and apparently good.</p>
                        <p>Now as in the Knowing faculties there is nothing at all of what they ought to know, the Underſtanding and the Senſes being to their Objects what the Matter is to the Form; when theſe Objects unite themſelves to theſe Faculties, they give them a perfection which they had not, and of which they were capable: And the knowledge they have of this perfection, is the cauſe of the agreement they finde therein, which is afterwards followed by that Love and Pleaſure which the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite forms, when the Underſtanding and the Imagination have propoſed it as a thing good and convenient for them.</p>
                        <p>But foraſmuch as there are Objects which cauſe more love and pleaſure then
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47499:78"/>others, they muſt neceſſarily much more perfect the knowing faculties, and it is thoſe infallibly which are the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to wit, thoſe who have the moſt of being and of eſſence as we have ſaid; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do much more fill the natural capacity which theſe faculties have to know the extent of that being which ſerves for their object. So it is onely God who can fill the underſtanding and give a perfect Love and Joy to the Will, becauſe it is he alone that poſſeſſeth all beeing; and conſequently thoſe things which have the moſt of it, perfect them proportionably, and cauſe alſo by their knowledge a greater ſatisfaction and a greater pleaſure: It is not but that often leſs perfect things do more content the Senſes and the Underſtanding; but this proceeds from the error which their ill inclinations give them, which commonly come from the temper, from cuſtome, and from weakneſs of ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>Now foraſmuch as knowledge is a good which reſpects not onely the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which exerciſe it, but alſo all others to which it may be profitable, becauſe that the Senſes were not given to the creature for themſelves, but for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47499:78"/>thereof, and that reaſon is a light which lights not it ſelf alone, but alſo all the other vertues which are in man; hence it is that the knowledge which the Senſes &amp; the underſtanding have of things, which in ſom manner are uſeful to the creature, perfects theſe faculties; becauſe that being deſtined to its ſervice they at laſt attain the end whether they tend, when they operate for it, and in that reſpect they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a perfection which in ſome ſort is more excellent then that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects them onely being their laſt end, and the mark nature propoſed for them; even thence it is that the eyes eſteem fair, all which makes the goodneſs of aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments known; and the colour of the wine or even of the water is for the ſame reaſon more pleaſing for a thirſty man to behold, then the faireſt green of the fields; In a word, all what the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the imagination know of ſeeing and hearing, being the obſervers of what is profitable or agreeable, is eſteemed fair, and perfects theſe faculties; foraſmuch as their perfection conſiſts to know what is for our uſe; it is thus that corporal beauty raviſheth the ſoul and the Senſes; becauſe it is the mark of that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47499:79"/>interior power which ought to render us more perfect; and its principally in this ſence that we may truely ſay, that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the flower and ſplendor of goodneſs. But before we ſhew how this power ought to render us more perfect, we muſt obſerve what we have already ſaid of theſe powers; for there are thoſe which reſpect the nature of man in general, and others which are proper to the ſexes.</p>
                        <p>Theſe have their particular diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which make the male and female beauty, and which being nothing but the inſtruments which they are to uſe in the performance of their functions, are alſo the marks which make known whether they may be well or ill done; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a male beauty is nothing elſe to our Senſes, but the mark of a good conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the active power in generation, in the ſame manner as a female beauty is the ſigne of a paſſive power to all that is neceſſary for the performance of that function. Now as generation is the moſt natural and moſt excellent of all the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which are common to creatures, for that it in ſom manner renders them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, it in ſom ſort alſo approacheth the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47499:79"/>Divine perfection and renders them like their cauſe and principle; we cannot doubt but nature hath imprinted in them a moſt powerful deſire, and alſo endued them with a knowledge which may ſerve to this inclination; its true, that this knowledge is obſcure and hid, and that it is to be found in our ſelves without the help of diſcourſe, and even without our thinking of it; and indeed it is in the ſame rank with that which nature hath inſpired in all the things of the world who know without underſtanding what is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them; for even in the actions of the Senſes and the Underſtanding we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there are objects, which are more pleaſing to us then others, the reaſon whereof is unknown to us, and we have nothing to ſay, but that there is in our ſouls a certain ſpring of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or rather that it is the Spirit of God which hides it ſelf in his works, and drives things to that end which is fit for them. For as an Artiſt manageth the action of natural things to the end he pretends, &amp; as we muſt aſcribe all that order which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the artifice to his knowledge, and not to the things he uſeth, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of that knowledge; ſo in all the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47499:80"/>things of nature, where we perceive ſo many marks of admirable wiſedom, we muſt not beleeve that it is from them that it proceeds, but that it is the Spirit of God which flowes in their effects, which gives the order and the motion, and which guids them to the end which he hath preſcribed for them.</p>
                        <p>However it be, it is by this obſcure and hid knowledge, that corporal beauty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it ſelf to our Senſes, the ſoul knows it for the mark of the natural power of that Sex wherein it is; &amp; at the ſame time that ſecret and powerful deſire which it hath to perpetuate its ſpecies, awakens and forms in it that Love which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards agitates it with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                        <p>Yet do I know very well, that an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured perſon, may cauſe the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſoul; and that it is not always true that beauty is the certain mark of the perfect diſpoſition of the powers which ſerve for generation; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it may affect thoſe who are of the ſame ſexe to whom this motive is uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>But as for unhanſomeneſs, we have
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47499:80"/>ſhewed in the Treatiſe of the Love out of inclination, that although that this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeems not to draw its origine from Beauty, yet there is in the ſoul a certain Idea of perfection contrary to that which the Senſes repreſented, which cauſeth this admirable charm. For the two other Objections which remain, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that Nature ſuffers defects in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, becauſe ſhe doth not always finde the matter obedient; whence it happens, that there are parts which remain imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: and becauſe we often abuſe the gifts ſhe beſtows, employing them in things contrary to the end which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her ſelf.</p>
                        <p>There is amongſt men another kinde of Love, which corporal beauty alſo may move, but whoſe motive is different from that whereof we ſpeak; for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects not the ſexe, but all the ſpecies; which being to have its vertues and its powers, ought alſo to have thoſe corporal diſpoſitions which are to ſerve it.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe diſpoſitions are natural, or acquired: The natural are thoſe which come from our births, and which render men capable of the functions of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: for, as all what is in Man is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47499:81"/>deſtined for the ſervice of that faculty which is miſtreſs of all the reſt, ſince it cannot know things but by the intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Senſes, and the Senſes cannot operate if their organs are not well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; of neceſſity the parts of the body muſt have ſome proportion and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Underſtanding: and then the Soul, which ſees by this ſecret ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which we have ſpoken, that it is the mark of humane perfection, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelf in this object, and forms that love which unites it to the good it knows. 'Tis thus, that well-form'd men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the ſight, becauſe that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral beauty which they have, is a ſigne that they are naturally fit for the moſt perfect actions of the Minde; and the knowledge which we thus have of their vertues, makes us love them as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good, which ought to render us the more perfect: For there is no vertue without doing good, either by giving us example, and obliging us to its imitation, or by the good things which its effects bring to every one of us in particular, and to all that ſociety for which Man is born, and to which all vertues, as well Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual as Moral, are as a foundation. As
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47499:81"/>for thoſe diſpoſitions which are acquired, they alſo mark the acquired vertues and powers, ſuch as thoſe habits are which are known by the Characters we here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of; that is to ſay, by their actions, as well Intellectual as Moral, and by the air, by the carriage and behaviour of the body, which makes one part of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral beauty: for, as there is a certain grace which accompanies vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when it appears to our eyes it makes us believe the vertues are there, and ſo forms that love which we have naturally for them.</p>
                        <p>It is not but that theſe marks are often deceitful, and that they often make us love ſubjects which we ought to hate; But it is from that the Knowledge, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this love, is as we have ſaid, obſcure and confuſed; it carries away the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite before diſcourſe can examine it, and ſo makes us love an imaginary good. Yet whatever the errour be, the Imagination and the Underſtanding always finde their perfection in the knowledge which the Senſes afford them, becauſe they do not believe they are deceived; and they think to diſcover, by that ſenſible beauty, that good which ought to accompany it, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47499:82"/>whoſe poſſeſſion might render us more perfect: wherefore they finde it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and propoſe it to the appetite as an object worthy of love, and affording pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the principles which may give to us the knowledge of the name and effects of Beauty: For, to examine all what could be ſaid in particular, we ſhould need whole Volumes; and theſe Subjects being too elevated, would tire the ſpirit with the length of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and would cauſe us to diſguſt a thing which ought never to be diſtaſtful. There is but one difficulty in this ſubject, which we dare not leave without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and the reſolution whereof is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing eaſie to finde: For, thoſe who are eſteemed fair in one Climate, are not ſo in another; and, even where ever it be, a face which may ſeem fair to ſome, will appear ugly to divers: Whence ſome have believed, that Beauty is neither a true nor real quality, and that it is but in opinion onely: but no man can diſavow, but that the proportion of the parts, and thoſe other things which make beauty, are true and real, and are qualities which ennoble the ſubject where they are, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47499:82"/>ſatisfie the minde and the ſight. Now ſince Nature propoſeth always to it ſelf perfection, and that there is but onely one true perfection in the order of all things; it muſt needs be, that ſhe deſigned a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular beauty to every ſpecies, which ought to be the Model of all thoſe which particulars may have: And as the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body is the beſt tempered of all others which are in Nature, it is probable that this perfect being ought to be in the moſt temperate Climate. But whence comes it then, that it is not acknowledged in other Climates; but on the contrary, there that is eſteemed fair, which in this is eſteemed ugly? For, the blackeſt amongſt the Moors are eſteemed the faireſt, the moſt ſhort-nos'd amongſt the Chinois; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                        <p>For my part, I belive we muſt ſay that the Climate gives a certain diſpoſition to the body, and makes it change in tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature; and that ſuch a temper gives ſuch an inclination and ſuch a power to the Minde. Now becauſe the bodies ought to be proportionable to the powers, it is a neceſſary conſequence, that the bodies in thoſe Climates muſt have the marks of theſe inclinations. So that Beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47499:83"/>in the proportion which the bodies have with their vertues and powers; and Men having ſuch powers in certain Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, they muſt eſteem thoſe fair which have thoſe marks, becauſe that theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are as it were natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them: ſo that they judge of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to their natural inclination, in the ſame manner as in temperate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries there are thoſe found who judge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly of Beauty, by reaſon of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular temper they have, which carries their judgements to prize what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough Nature ſeem avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of Pleaſure and of Delight, and that ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it always with Grief, ſhe makes us beleeve that ſhe affords it us but with regret and reſtraint; yet muſt we confeſs that there is nothing in the world, wherein her liberality and magnificence appear more; and we may ſay, that all her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſents are debts which ſhe pays, but that this is purely a grace and favour of hers; for although ſhe gives a being to every thing, that ſhe hath a care of its preſervation, and brings it to its end, ſhe is obliged thereunto; and there is nothing in the Univerſe, which may not with juſtice ask her what is neceſſary for the perfection of its being; but as action is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47499:84"/>the end and perfection of all things, when they are arrived there they can exact no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from nature, who hath acquitted herſelf of all ſhe owed them, and if ſhe contributes any thing, it is by favour and not by obligation; ſo that cauſing always delight to flow on thoſe actions which are conformable to it, and in a manner crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with it, we ought not to doubt that it is a ſingular effect of her muniſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or the better to expreſs it, the ſum fo all the graces ſhe could beſtow.</p>
                     <p>Knowing alſo how pretious it was, ſhe hath onely communicated it to the moſt noble and the moſt excellent things; ſhe eſteemed thoſe without knowledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, and that Sence and Reaſon onely could deſerve it; even as if it were a good which ought not to be poſſeſt but in heaven, ſhe would not permit it to be pure and perfect here below; ſhe hath mingled it with cares and with pains, ſhe hath brewed it with tears and hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to begin or to finiſh alwayes with grief.</p>
                     <p>But as the Sun ceaſeth not to be the faireſt and moſt profitable thing in the world, although it hath blemiſhes and ſuffer eclipſes: So how imperfect ſoever
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47499:84"/>pleaſure be, by what mixture ſoever it hath been weakened, yet ought it not to hinder us from prizing it as the moſt excellent and moſt deſirable thing which could ever happen to mankinde; and we may truely ſay, that it is the light of all other good things, and that were it taken away from our lives, it would nothing but horrour and confuſion; our life it would indeed rather be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual flood of ills then of yeers; the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would rather ſerve for gates of grief then of knowledge; knowledge it ſelf would paſs for an affliction of ſpirit, and vertue for a grievous ſervitude. Its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure onely which ſets a price on all things, and which renders them delightful; at leaſt they appear not good, but by ſo much as it is found mingled with them; and did not the ſoul hope to encounter it in all it acts, it would remain languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and immoveable, it would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out action and without vigor, and we muſt ſpeak no more of life, of happineſs or of felicity.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, to ſee the effect, it cauſeth, as miſtris and deſpencer of all good things, calling back thoſe which are paſt, making us ſenſible of thoſe which are not yet,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47499:85"/>rendring even melancholy, tears and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers pleaſing; we muſt confeſs that with reaſon Nature is called the great Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and that pleaſure is the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful charme ſhe uſeth to produce her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; In effect, its a charm which makes all the ills which aſſault us vaniſh, which lifts us up beyond our ſelves, which changeth us into other men, and from men transforms us into Demy-Gods; but we often uſe it as a poyſon, which quencheth all that is Divine in our Souls, which renders our mindes brutiſh, and makes us like, even inferiour to beaſts.</p>
                     <p>For although the pleaſures of the body are of themſelves innocent, and that they were given us for inticements to the moſt neceſſary and moſt noble actions of life; yet when we pervert their uſe, and when we do not render them obedient to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they rebel againſt it, pull it out of its throne, precipitate it in dirt and mire, and ſtifle all the ſeeds of vertue and underſtanding which are born with it.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there any thing wherein wiſedom hath more been imployed, then to ſeek the means whereby to ſhun ſo
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47499:85"/>dangerous an enemy, who flatters at its admittance, and afterwards cauſeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where trouble and confuſion, which fills the Soul with blood and flames, the Body with grief and infirmity, and leaves nothing behind it but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>We will not propoſe the counſels and advice ſhe hath given on this ſubject; we ſhould bring hither all thoſe lawes, which Phyſick, Morality, and Religion have preſcribed; at leaſt there are but few which were not made either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or correct the diſorders which ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality may cauſe; yet we think to ſecond its deſign, by ſhewing the deformity which the exceſs of this Paſſion produceth in the Soul and in the Body.</p>
                     <p>The Picture of voluptuouſneſs cannot be made without repreſenting many figures, beſides that there are joys which have no commerce with the body, and which are to be found in the higheſt part of the ſoul: thoſe of the Senſe are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent amongſt themſelves, that as many pleaſing objects as there are which may move them, we may ſay that there are alſo as many ſeveral ſorts of Pleaſures: And truely, whoever would deſigne the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47499:86"/>portraicture we undertake according to the order of the Senſes, and deſcribe the pleaſure which every of them may be ſenſible of, the invention and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure could not be ill; but we may not uſe it without prejudice to other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, wherein we are to imploy the ſame touches, and the ſame colours which this requires; for if we ſtayed to expreſs the Characters of Pleaſure, which is in taſting and touching; we muſt neceſſarily alſo deſcribe thoſe of Gluttony, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Impudency, and ſo of the reſt, whereof we ſhould make particular Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; wherefore without parcelling theſe things, we will chuſe what is common to all Pleaſures, dividing this diſcourſe into two parts; the one of which ſhall treat of a ſerious Joy, where laughter is not to be found, and the other of a laughing puft up Joy, which is nothing but the Paſſion of Laughter.</p>
                     <p>Joy is not amongſt thoſe Paſſions whoſe beginning is weak, and whoſe progreſs is vehement; it hath all its force and greatneſs from its birth, and time ſerves for nothing but to weaken or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it; as ſoon as it enters the Soul it tranſports it and carries it out of it ſelf,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47499:86"/>and the raviſhment it cauſeth is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo violent that it takes away the uſe of the Senſes, makes it forſake the cares of life and often loſe it; but although it come not to this exceſs, yet it is alwayes known by that puft up impatience, which appears in all its actions, that it hardly can contain it ſelf within its bounds, that it makes eſcapes and endeavours to goe out.</p>
                     <p>For the thoughts and words of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented man are not to be ſtopt; he dreams onely of his good fortune, he ſpeaks continually of it, and if he be not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted he hath nothing in his heart which he carries not on his tongue; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his moſt ſecret deſignes, and ſo makes his joy an enemy to his reſt and to his contentment.</p>
                     <p>If he is ſilent, you muſt entertain him with diſcourſes onely which favour his Paſſion; how divertiſing ſoever others are, to him they are importunate; he breaks them at every moment, and it brings in alwayes ſomewhat of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> or at leaſt his little minding of them, ſeems a ſigne of his ſcorning them, or a reproaching that they interrupt his Pleaſure.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:47499:87"/>
                     <p>But if you ſpeak of the ſubject which begot them, if you admire his happineſs, if you witneſs a fellow-feeling with him; then, how angry or ſevere ſoever he be, he becometh complacent, he careſſeth, embraceth, and often, by ridiculous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities and favours, he forgeteth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he owes, or loſeth that which is due to him.</p>
                     <p>The firſt that comes to him, is made his friend and his confident; he takes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of him, he follows his advice; and it often happens to be a childe, a ſervant, or an enemy whom he truſts with his ſecret, and with its conduct. In this blindneſs, he approves all what is propoſed to him to the advantage of his Paſſion: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vanities he nouriſheth, whatever ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes he flatters himſelf withal, there is nothing in his opinion which he ought not to believe, and may not hope; as if all things were to reſpect his pleaſures: He believes that there are none which dare traverſe them; he ſees the dangers which every way inviron them, without ſtartling at it; and with a blinde confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he believes himſelf ſecure, when his loſs is often moſt aſſured: So that we may ſay, that there is no man ſo credulous
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47499:87"/>with ſo little appearance, ſo bold with ſo much weakneſs, nor ſo unhappie with ſo much good hap.</p>
                     <p>He would make us believe he were content, he perſwades it himſelf, and in the mean time his deſires betray his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne and his contentment: for they are irritated by the enjoyment; and carrying themſelves onely towards thoſe goods which he hath not, they render thoſe uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs which he poſſeſſeth, and even of his joy cauſe the ſubject of his diſquiet. Pleaſure hath that property, that although we enjoy it, it forbears not to make it ſelf deſirable; ſo that it is never content, and that it is rather weary of the good which entertains it, then fully ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. But we have ſpoken enough of the trouble it moves in the Minde: let us ſee what it cauſeth in the Face.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome pleaſures of which we may ſay the Soul is jealous, which it ſeems ſhe would poſſeſs in ſecret, and which ſhe dares not communicate to the Senſes: But what care ſoever ſhe takes to hide them, ſhe cannot do it ſo well, but ſhe muſt diſcover ſomething; her retreat renders her ſuſpected; and when ſhe would hide, 'tis then ſhe the more diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47499:88"/>her ſelf: For, the looks become fixt and ſtaid; all the body is immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the Senſes forget their functions; in fine, there is a general ſuſpenſion made of all the animal vertues. And although at firſt we might doubt whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from aſtoniſhment or grief, which often produce the ſame effects, 'tis after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcovered by a certain gloſs which remains on the face, and by I know not what ſweetneſs which it leaves in the eyes, and by a light image of ſmiling which appears on the lips, that theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Paſſions have no ſhare in this tranſport, and that it comes from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy, which raviſheth, and as it were inebriates the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>But when Pleaſure hath the liberty to diſperſe it ſelf abroad, and that the Senſes bear a part, and that the Minde and the Body ſeem to enter again into commerce and intelligence; then it is eaſie to know the agitation which is made in the ſoul, by what appears in the exteriour parts: You ſee on the face a certain vivacity, a pleaſing diſquiet, and a laughing boldneſs. Pleaſure ſparkles in the eyes, ſweetneſs accompanies all their motions; and when they happen to weep, or to caſt forth
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47499:88"/>ſome dying looks, you would ſay, Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confounded it ſelf with Tears, and that Jollity mixed it ſelf with Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: The <hi>Forehead</hi> is in this calm and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, the eye-brows are not lifted up with wrinkles nor with clouds; and it ſeems as if it opened, and every way extended it ſelf. The <hi>Lips</hi> are red and moiſt, and are never forſaken by ſmiles; and that light trembling which ſometimes happens to them, would make one think they danced for joy: The <hi>Voice</hi> becomes greater then ordinary; ſometimes it is reſounding; and it never goes out but with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for there is no Paſſion ſo talkative as Joy; how barren ſoever the Minde be, what heavineſs ſoever there be on the tongue, it makes one ſpeak continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: and nothing but its own violence ſometimes ſtops the mouth, and at once cuts ſhort the ſpeech. To conclude, all the face takes an extraordinary good plight; and from pale melancholy and ſevere, which it was before, it becomes ruddy, affable, and pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of the body is alſo ſenſible of this alteration: A ſweet heat &amp; vapor ſheds it ſelf thorow all its parts; which ſwells, and gives them a lively colour: even they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47499:89"/>become ſtronger, and do their actions more perfectly then they did before. In effect, of all the motions of the Minde, there is none more a friend to Health then this, ſo as it be not extreme. It drives away ſickneſs, it purifies the blood and the ſpirits, and renders, as the Wiſe man ſays, our yeers flouriſhing. As ſoon as it enters the <hi>heart,</hi> it ſwells it with great beatings; it lifts up the heart by long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations. In the Arteries it cauſeth a large and extended pulſe. And yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all theſe motions are made ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without vehemency, thoſe of the other parts are made with precipitation and vigour. The head and the eyes are in a continual agitation: the hands move without ceaſing: we go, we come, we leap; we cannot ſtay in one place. But it ſometimes alſo happens, that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of this Paſſion takes quite away the uſe of Senſe and Motion; it quencheth natural heat, it cauſeth ſyncopes, and in a moment bereaves one of life. Let us then examine how it can produce ſo many effects ſo contrary and ſo wonderful.</p>

                        <head>PART. 2. <hi>Of the Nature of</hi> JOY.</head>
                        <p>SOme perhapes may think it ſtrange, that Joy which ſpeaks ſo much of it ſelf, hath not as yet told what it was; but you may much more wonder that Philoſophy, which promiſeth us the knowledge of all things, falls ſhort in this; although there be nothing which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours more to make it ſelf known then Pleaſure; It penetrates to the bottome of our ſoul, it environs it on all ſides, it ſollicites it by all the wayes of its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; it is the end of all its deſires, the crown of all its actions, and yet for all that its nature is unknown to it, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt underſtandings which have enquired it, are not agreed under what kinde it ought to be placed.</p>
                        <p>For ſome have ſaid that Pleaſure was nothing but the reſt and tranquillity of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47499:90"/>the minde; others that it was a Paſſion in which the Soul operated not; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who have ranked it amongſt actions, ſome did beleeve it proceeded not from appetite but from knowledge. In fine, there having been ſome who not daring to put it in the rank of other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, have ſaid it was the principle of them, others that it was their gender, or their firſt ſpecies.</p>
                        <p>Had we not baniſhed from our deſigne the wrangling and the Criticiſms of the Schools, we ſhould be obliged to examine all theſe opinions, and to ſeek in their ruines foundations whereon we ſhould build the definition and Idea of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But ſince we have not that liberty, and that we ſhould render delight impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and unpleaſing by the length of the diſcourſes we ſhould uſe, without adviſing with any we will conſult the thing it ſelf, and ſee whether it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf to us after having hid it ſelf to ſo many excellent ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>We ſay then that we need not doubt, but that Pleaſure is a motion of the mind, and that its impoſſible to conceive a calm and reſt in the tempeſt which it raiſeth in our thoughts, in our ſpirits, and in our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47499:90"/>humors; as thoſe things doe not move of themſelves, it muſt be the minde which agitates them, and ſhe gives her ſelf the ſame ſhake which ſhe imprints in them; For it is evident that effects being like their cauſes, the motions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which are the effects of the minde, ought alſo to be the images of the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe gives her ſelf; I know well that the Schooles will not call theſe agitations true motions; but that ſtops us not, it will ſuffice that they are ſuch as the ſoul can have, &amp; that pleaſure is one of that order.</p>
                        <p>But yet as ſhe hath two parts which may be moved, we might doubt to which of the two Pleaſure belongs; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the world confeſs it is a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently a motion of the appetite, yet it ſeems that there are ſome which are proper to knowledge, ſince the Senſes and the underſtanding finde a complacency in the objects which are conformable to them, even before that the appetite is moved; but alſo as we have already ſhewed in our diſcourſe of Love, that this complacency is no true pleaſure; and that the <hi>Daemons</hi> which are capable of that acceptableneſs, cannot be touched with Joy, which yet they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47499:91"/>ought moſt perfectly to have; if it come from knowledge alone, we muſt then ſtick to the common opinion, and with it ſay, that Pleaſure is a motion of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, ſince its good which moves that part of the minde, and that pleaſure hath no other object but the ſame good.</p>
                        <p>Yet this raiſeth another difficulty; for if it be true that the ſoul ceaſeth to move, when it arives at the end whereto it tended moving to poſſeſs a good, the poſſeſſion ought to be the end and term of its motion: So that the pleaſure which comes alwayes after the poſſeſſion is rather a reſt then a motion of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; and yet if we were agreed that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion is the aim and end of the motions of the minde, we would ſay that that onely ought to be underſtood of thoſe which it employs to arrive thereunto; for although it bear it ſelf not towards the good it poſſeſſeth, it hinders it not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitating to taſte it again, and from being raviſhed in the enjoyment it hath had; but to ſpeak more exactly, poſſeſſion is not the laſt end which the ſoul propoſeth; it is the enjoyment which is the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and accompliſhment of the poſſeſſion. For it is certain we poſſeſs things which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47499:91"/>we enjoy not, and we may ſay that the good renders it ſelf maſter of the Soul when it preſents and unites it ſelf unto it, but that ſhe becomes miſtris of it when ſhe enjoys it: After all this we can never ſay that reſt is the end which the ſoul propoſeth to it ſelf, ſince the end is the perfection of things, and that there are ſome which muſt be always in action to be perfect: Now the ſoul is of this kinde, ſhe never tends to reſt unleſs out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and it is therefore neceſſary that Joy and Enjoyment be in motion; let us then ſee what an one it is.</p>
                        <p>To diſcover it, we muſt obſerve that Pleaſure and Joy are never formed in the ſoul, till after the good hath inſpired Love therein; for as the firſt motion of the appetite towards good is to unite it ſelf thereunto, and Love conſiſts in this union; it is impoſſible that any man ſhould fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy any other motion which could be poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that; and therefore if Pleaſure be a motion of the ſoul towards good, it ought to preſuppoſe love, &amp; always come after it.</p>
                        <p>Now as this Love always precedes, it follows not that it muſt always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it; there may be obſtacles which may hinder the appetite from moving to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47499:92"/>form this Paſſion, and grief perhaps may be ſo great that it may employ the whole ſoul, that it will not admit the leaſt ray of Joy; but its alſo certain, that if there be nothing which retains the appetite, it always goes from Love to Pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſoul unites it ſelf to good, but to enjoy it, and it is impoſſible it ſhould enjoy it but by Pleaſure; and to ſpeak truth, enjoyment is nothing but pleaſure which we finde in the poſſeſſion of good; and according as enjoyment is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is alſo the greater and the more excellent. What motion can the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite then ſuffer in pleaſure and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond that of Love, whereby it unites it ſelf to what is good? certainly it is a thing very difficult to conceive, how theſe actions ſhould paſs into a power which is quite blinde and hid in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the ſoul; they muſt be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſcure, and what light ſoever the minde can bring, they ſuffer themſelves to be ſeen not without a great deal of trouble; yet ſince we have engaged our ſelves to ſhew the difference of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the difference of corporal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we muſt neceſſarily, to know what Joy is, finde in ſenſible things a kinde of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47499:92"/>motion which may reſemble the agitation which the Minde ſuffers in this encounter. As it happens then in the Paſſion of Love, that the Appetite carries it ſelf towards the beloved object, that it runs thither, and unites it ſelf thereunto; we may ſay, that this motion is like to that of fluid bodies, which run toward their centre, and think to finde their reſt there: but becauſe when they are there, they for all that ſtop not, they return, and ſcatter themſelves on themſelves; they ſwell, and conſequently over-flow. So, after that the Appetite is united to its good, its motion ends not there; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the ſame way, ſcatters it ſelf on it ſelf, and over-flows thoſe powers which are neereſt to it. By this effuſion, the ſoul doubles on the image of the good it hath received, mixeth and confoundeth it ſelf with it, and ſo thinks to poſſeſs it the more by doubly uniting it ſelf thereunto. Nay, even as the Appetite ſwells, and thicks by this reflux; it cannot contain it ſelf within its bounds, and is conſtrained to diſtil it ſelf into that faculty which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted it with the knowledge of the object; ſharing with it the good it hath received, and by that means making all
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47499:93"/>the parts of the ſoul concur to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, wherein perfect enjoyment conſiſts: For, ſince the ſoul hath no other end, but perfectly to poſſeſs the good, and that, perfectly to poſſeſs it, it muſt have the knowledge of that poſſeſſion; the Appetite having no knowledge, cannot alone make it enjoy what it loves; the Imagination and the Underſtanding muſt contribute: and then, after they have propoſed the good to the Appetite, and that the Appetite is united thereunto, it returns to the one and to the other, and gives them an account of what it hath done, to the end that by uniting their functions, the ſoul may unite it ſelf to its good in all its parts, and that it may make for it that circular motion which is natural to it, and wherein the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfection of its operations conſiſts, as the Platonick Philoſophy teacheth. After all, if it be true that the Soul and the Spirits work in the ſame manner in the Paſſions, we may not doubt but that the motion which the ſoul ſuffers in Joy, is ſuch as we have ſaid, ſince that of the ſpirits is altogether like it: For, after Love hath carried them to good, they ſcatter and over-flow themſelves on
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47499:93"/>the organs of the Senſes, as we are about to make known: So that we cannot miſs in ſaying, <hi>That Joy is an effuſion of the Appetite, whereby the Soul ſpreads it ſelf on what is good, to poſſeſs it the more perfectly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I know that the definition of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is quite different from this: for he ſays that it is a motion of the Soul which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and ſenſibly puts it in a ſtate agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Nature. But the place where he propoſeth it, ſhews ſufficiently that he had no intention to render it very exact, treating in that place but with Orators, and not with Philoſophers. And truely, whoever will neerly examine it, will finde nothing leſs then the eſſence of that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. How many of thoſe motions will there be found, ſuch as he hath obſerved, wherein Pleaſure will never be? All natural actions, do they not put the ſoul in a ſtate agreeable to its nature? and may they not be ſuddenly and ſenſibly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without being for all that delightful? The Paſſion of Love, is it not ſo formed, and is it not an eſtate agreeable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to unite it ſelf to good, and to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it; and yet Pleaſure need not always accompany it? And may we not then ſay, that it is not Joy which makes this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47499:94"/>condition agreeable to Nature; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is that which breeds Joy?</p>
                        <p>Beſides, what need we ſay it is a ſudden motion, ſeeing the Appetite hath none that are other? For, if it happens that the ſoul moves not ſo readily in ſome Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that Iazineſs comes not from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, but from the faculty which propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that good with too much difficulty, and too looſely commands the purſuit thereof: Being a blinde power, it goes but as 'tis led; and as ſoon as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is given, it obeys, and moves in an inſtant.</p>
                        <p>It is true, there may be obſtacles on that ſide, which may hinder it from ſo readily obeying; as, when there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Paſſions to thoſe which the object ought to inſpire; for an extreme grief will never ſuffer Joy to form it ſelf in the Appetite: But alſo, when the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance is away, it quickly moves, and always in a moment produceth the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as perfect as the knowledge and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive was which it propoſed: For, if Love hath weak-beginnings, 'tis becauſe the good is weakly repreſented, and the progreſſes it makes, are new motions of the Appetite, cauſed by the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47499:94"/>of new Ideas and new perfections.</p>
                        <p>In effect, we may ſay of all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and of all the increaſe of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they are as the flame and the light, which entertain and augment one the other every moment, by an infinite many reiterated productions; that which appears, being not that which was before, and which even preſently will be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a new: for, all of them ſucceeding thus one the other without interruption, ſeem to be but the ſelf-ſame thing which hath preſerved and entertained it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>So it is in Joy, and in all other Paſſions; they form themſelves all at once, and paſs in an inſtant: they are alſo renewed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, cauſing thus a continual flux of divers perfect motions, which laſt as long as the knowledge ſollicites the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to move.</p>
                        <p>It is then true, that the Appetite hath no motions which are not ſudden; That nevertheleſs it begins to move it ſelf ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one time then another, by how much the faculty which commands is diligent or lazie, or becauſe there is ſome contrary motion which retains it: And that is eaſie to be conceived, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Eyes, which ſee things in an
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47499:95"/>inſtant, although to ſee them they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times open quicker or ſlower; and even after being open, they may have ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition which may hinder them to act.</p>
                        <p>I know that the Phyſitians ſeem to uſe the ſame definition with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when they ſay that Pleaſure is a quick and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motion which puts Nature in an eſtate which is agreeable to it; and that if the objects make not a quick and ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the Senſes, or if they do not make it proportionable to Nature, they can never cauſe Pleaſure. But it is eaſie to perceive, that the Motion whereof they ſpeak, is not that of the Appetite, where Pleaſure conſiſts, and that it is but the cauſe thereof: for, before that the Appetite moves, the objects muſt make ſuch an impreſſion as we have ſaid; and then the Soul, which feels it, and which ſees what is its good, ſheds it ſelf on it, to poſſeſs it the more perfectly, and ſo forms that pleaſure, which is augmented by the effuſion of ſpirits, as we will anon declare. I ſtay not to examine how grief ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens in this quick motion which moves Nature to an eſtate convenient for it; as when we put our hands to the fire when they are extremely cold; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47499:95"/>the Paſſion of Grief: It will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice here to obſerve, that thoſe objects which make not this ready impreſſion, do not cauſe Pleaſure; becauſe that inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating themſelves by little and little, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture accuſtoms her ſelf unto them, and feels not the change which happens to her; wherefore, not knowing the good which ſhe receives, the Imagination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it not to the Appetite, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is not moved thereby. We are even thus tir'd with the moſt agreeable things, after having too long taſted them. But of this more amply at the end of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>Let us continue again the thred of that Diſcourſe which we have left, and ſay, that although all the motions of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite are made ſuddenly, yet it is true, that of all the objects which move Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are none whoſe arrival ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo eaſily moves the Appetite, as Joy. And this comes in my conceit, from that the object of Pleaſure is the good, ſo far as it is already loved: for we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, that Love always precedes Joy; ſo that being already united to the Appetite by the means of Love, there is nothing in that reſpect which hinders the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47499:96"/>motion which that power ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to reliſh it. But it is not ſo in the reſt of the Paſſions, whoſe objects are to be examined by the Knowledge, before they are propoſed to the Appetite. And as there are but few Goods or Evils which are pure, ſo there are always found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which diminiſh their goodneſs or their ill, and ſuſpend the judgement we ought to make of them. But to move Joy, this examen is uſeleſs: the Appetite already poſſeſſing the Good, all its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are taken, all its doubts are razed; and of neceſſity it ought to move at the ſame inſtant when it united it ſelf to its enjoyment, wherein Joy and Pleaſure conſiſt.</p>
                        <p>But 'tis to penetrate too far into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Soul, and to ſtay too long on things which have no ſtay. Let us leave theſe imperceptible motions, and ſee whether thoſe which are made in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and in the ſpirits, are more eaſie to be diſcerned.</p>
                        <p>Yet before we begin this enquiry, we ſhall do well to ſay ſomewhat of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which moves this Paſſion. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have already ſaid it was Good, we muſt examine out of what conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47499:96"/>it merits that quality, being aſſured that out of divers reſpects it cauſeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers motions in the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>As then good, foraſmuch as it is amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is the object of Love; ſo foraſmuch as it is delightful it is that of Joy: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it powerfully delightful, but when it is loved, for that Pleaſure preſuppoſeth Love; ſo that good foraſmuch as it is loved, ought to be the true object of Joy; perhaps you will ſay, that deſire alſo preſuppoſeth Love, and that good muſt be loved to be deſired; it is true, but deſire demands another condition, to wit, abſence which never happens in Joy, where the good muſt be alwayes preſent; for when paſt things, or thoſe which are to come delight us, it is an effect of the imagination, which renders them preſent, and makes them paſs for ſuch as they are in the thoughts.</p>
                        <p>For the reſt, by the word Good, we muſt not onely conceive what is truely and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently good, but even alſo the ills which we have eſchewed: It is thus, that the memory of the paines we have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and of the dangers we have eſcaped is pleaſing, foraſmuch as it is good to have been delivered from them; it is thus that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47499:97"/>vengeance is ſo ſweet; becauſe that by overcoming the ill, we no more fear the aſſaults thereof; it is thus, that tears are ſometimes delightful, becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge nature of an unprofitable burthen, and that it even ſeems as if the grief which excited them, runs and ſlides away with them.</p>
                        <p>You muſt beſides obſerve, that good being a thing agreeable to nature, this is aſwel to be underſtood of depraved na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as of that which is perfect; for a ſick man takes pleaſure in things which are contrary to him, and a vitious man finds contentment in his debauches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are conformable to his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and irregular nature.</p>
                        <p>Now after this to examine by retail all what may cauſe pleaſure, beſides that it would wrong both our deſign, and the Reader, both which ask for brevity, we may eaſily know it were but to loſe time and words.</p>
                        <p>It will then ſuffice to ſay, that ſince good is the ſource of all the ſweets which this Paſſion cauſeth to flow into the ſoul, and that it is nothing but what is fit for our nature, and what perfects it, it muſt be that the good which makes us the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47499:97"/>more perfect, raiſes alſo the greater &amp; the more ſolid pleaſures: Now as we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two parts, of ſoul and body, and as that is incomparably more excellent; and therefore it follows that the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it acquireth is alſo more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and that the goods which cauſe it, are the moſt noble and the moſt delightful.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe the goods of the body are for the preſervation of the ſpecies, or of the individuals, and that that is more conſiderable to nature, as being the moſt common or the moſt general good; from thence it is that the pleaſure which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies it is the ſweeteſt and moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of all others; and by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the objects of Taſting and feeling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light moſt, becauſe they are the Senſes moſt neceſſary for life, and without which the creature cannot ſubſiſt.</p>
                        <p>It is true that the objects of Seeing and Hearing may conteſt the preheminency, being more noble then thoſe baſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial qualities which reſpect the inferior Senſes: But if we conſider that there are almoſt no creatures, which delight themſelves with the beauty of ſounds and colours; we may confeſs ſpeaking gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that the objects of Taſting and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47499:98"/>Touching are the moſt delightful; and yet that in Man thoſe of Seeing and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have the advantage, becauſe that thoſe two Senſes having a great affinity with the Underſtanding, and being chiefly deſtined to its ſervice, their end is alſo more noble &amp; neceſſary then it is in beaſts, where they are for no other uſe, but to preſerve the animal life which they have.</p>
                        <p>From all theſe conſiderations, it is eaſie to deduce the principal differences of Pleaſure: For it is either Intellectual or Senſible, Pure or Impure, True or Falſe. True Pleaſures are thoſe which are pure, to wit, which are not linked or mixed with Grief; and they are thoſe which are fit for Man, in the moſt perfect condition that Nature could place him. Such are the pleaſures which are found in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the exerciſe of Vertue: ſuch are thoſe which follow the actions of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Health, and the functions of Senſes perfectly diſpoſed.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe Pleaſures have this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they are long laſting, that they never tire, that they may be reliſhed at all times, and that Grief never precedes nor follows them: For a man who is in a ſtate of Natural perfection, is never weary of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47499:98"/>Meditation, nor of performing good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Life is always ſweet and pleaſing to him; and the Senſes are always diſpoſed to receive their Objects with Delight.</p>
                        <p>Some may now ſay, that Eating and Drinking, and other natural actions, are convenient for the perfect nature of Man, which yet cauſe alſo diſguſt: For Muſick, and the ſight of the faireſt things, at laſt tires the ears and eyes; and the ſweeteſt flowers wherewith <hi>Venus</hi> was ever crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>Pindarus</hi> ſays, at laſt become impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and diſpleaſing. It is true: But we muſt alſo remember, that all theſe things being ſutable to Nature, ought to have the conditions which perfection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: they muſt be moderate in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and quality: the circumſtance of time, place, and perſons, muſt meet. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the greateſt part are not of themſelves convenient for Nature, but onely by accident; that is to ſay, they are onely convenient, by reaſon of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities which preceded them whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy they are. So eating and drinking cure hunger and thirſt: ſo reſt and ſleep cauſe labour and wearineſs to ceaſe. In a word, the greateſt part of our actions afford pleaſure onely becauſe Nature
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47499:99"/>empties or fills it ſelf, and corrects the one with the other; wherefore the pleaſure which follows them is not abſolutely pure nor real, but onely by accident: whence it is that it tires, that it laſts but little, and that we are not at all times capable to taſte it, as thoſe which are abſolutely pure.</p>
                        <p>But let us leave theſe Moral Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, without ſtaying any longer on things which are notorious to all the world, let us ſeek new ones, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tempeſt which this Paſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites in us, will not throw us into ſome unknown Land, and make us know the motions of the Spirits which act as the wandering Stars, whoſe courſes and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods have not yet been obſerved.</p>

                        <head>PART 3. <hi>What the Motion of</hi> JOY <hi>is in the Spirits.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>IN all kinde of Motion, we muſt always fancie two terms: The one where it is to begin, the other where it ought to finiſh. If the Spirits then move in Joy, it ſeems they ought to come from the heart, ſince it is their ſource; and thence they move themſelves towards what is Good, whereſoever it preſents it ſelf to the ſoul. Truely, could Joy form it ſelf all alone, the motion of the Spirits muſt be ſo made, and muſt by it be iſſued out of the heart to the meeting of what is good: but becauſe it never comes but with Love, which ought always to precede it, it is he who ought to cauſe that motion, whereto Joy contributes nothing: So that we muſt ſeek another for it, conformable
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47499:100"/>with that of the Appetite. In a word, we muſt diſcover how the Spirits in ſome manner diſperſe themſelves, even as that doth in this Paſſion. This will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſily be conceived, after having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how Love carries them towards Good: for when they can go no further, they muſt either ſtop, or return to their ſource, or diſperſe themſelves. They cannot ſtop themſelves, ſince they follow the then-diſturbed agitation of the ſoul: they cannot return to the heart, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the preſence of Ill can conſtrain them thereunto: They muſt then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow and diſperſe themſelves. And the Soul, which employs the ſame motives for the motion of the Spirits as for her own, takes care to make them move ſo, that they may be the more united to Good, as we have before ſaid: For, by this effuſion, they dilate themſelves in their organs; and, occupying more room, they think to touch the Good in more of its parts.</p>
                        <p>But where can they diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? To underſtand this, you muſt remember, that Good toucheth not the ſoul but by its preſence, and that it is Knowledge onely which renders it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47499:100"/>Now this Knowledge is made by the Underſtanding, and by the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by the Senſes: And as the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſeated in the brain, and the Senſes in their particular organs; ſo Good muſt be in the one or the other of them, and conſequently Love muſt carry the Spirits to thoſe places, and Joy diſperſe them in the ſame precincts. For, if Good be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Fancie, and that it toucheth not the exteriour Senſes, all the Spirits ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the ſeat of the Imagination, and diſperſe themſelves in the brain: But if any of the Senſes poſſeſs this Good, then the Spirits which ran thither diſperſe themſelves alſo on their organs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thither heat, redneſs, and vivacity.</p>
                        <p>This effuſion augments the Pleaſure of the Minde, by reaſon of that ſweet and temperate heat which runs thorow the parts, which flatters and tickles them: So that thoſe Pleaſures which are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with this corporal agitation, are greater, and more ſenſible, then when they are without it. Nay, even after the emotion of the Appetite hath ceaſed, the agitation of the Spirits continuing, leaves the ſoul in a certain confuſed Joy, which comes not from the object which at firſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47499:101"/>touched it, but from that tickling which the Senſes made known unto it, as a thing conformable and convenient for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>And this makes me believe that all thoſe ſecret Joys which we feel without knowing a reaſon of them, come from the ſame cauſe, and that there muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſomething which diſperſeth the Spirits, and which inſpires Pleaſure in the ſoul; whether it be the knowledge it hath of the tickling of thoſe parts, or whether that all the differences of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which it employs in every Paſſion, being known unto her, ſhe ſees this to be fit for Joy, and at the ſame time forms a delightful object, as we ſaid it happened in that love which is out of inclination.</p>
                        <p>You will perhaps ſay, that this effuſion of Spirits may often be without Pleaſure; That Anger which caſts them into the face, that Grief which draws them to the diſeaſed parts, and that the Fever which drives them everywhere with impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, afterwards diſperſeth them, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſame alteration which Joy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints on the body; and yet that the Soul is then ſenſible of no pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>But we may two ways anſwer this:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47499:101"/>Firſt, it is true, that the moſt delightful objects are often diverted by little griefs, from making an impreſſion in the ſoul. This motion of the Spirits which is ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and which the Senſes can ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, ought to be far leſs powerful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt great obſtacles which cauſe theſe troubleſome encounters. But ſuppoſing they did cauſe pleaſure, it is ſo weak, and ſo light, that it is ſtifled by the leaſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inconvenience. For it is an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, that although it ſeems that the Senſitive Appetite at the ſame time can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer contrary Paſſions, it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely true, ſince we evidently know, that the tongue is pleaſed with agreeable ſavours, whilſt the heart is full of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and grief. And the reaſon of this is, that the Senſitive Appetite is not ſhut up in one part onely, as the moſt part of the other faculties are; it is diſperſed thorow all the organs of the Senſes: and we may ſay, that its ſtock and root are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the heart, but that its boughs and branches are extended thorow all the body: For its a general and neceſſary power to all the parts of the Creature, and it muſt have been communicated to all, that Motion might not be far off from
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47499:102"/>knowledge, and that the Soul might not languiſh in expectation to poſſeſs a good, or flee from an ill, when they were once come to her knowledge: Nature having made for the appetite what ſhe made for the pulſe whoſe principal organ is the heart, and yet which forms it ſelf in all the arteries, where even it is ſometimes found different from that which agitates the heart.</p>
                        <p>Which being ſo, Pleaſure may be in one place, and Grief in another, although they are in one part incompatible: But it is alſo true that when Paſſion is raiſed in the Centre, and ſource of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, that which is in the little rivulets is very weak and ſeems to vaniſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Spirits ceaſe not to agitate in thoſe places where it was formed, whence theſe ſecret feelings of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure follow, which often ſteal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the knowledge of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, nay even of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>This is the firſt anſwer which may be made to the propoſed objection; now for another which pleaſeth us more, as being better fitted to our deſigne; for we will ſhow how every Paſſion hath a particular
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47499:102"/>motion of the ſpirits; and that then if the effuſion be in others as well as Joy, there muſt be ſome difference which renders it fit and particular, and which is not to be found in the reſt.</p>
                        <p>We muſt then confeſs that Anger, Grief, and Terrour, and divers other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior things may diſperſe the ſpirits, but by violence, and as a tempeſt which ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the rain, and tranſports it here and there with impetuoſity; in ſtead where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Joy ſweetly diſperſeth them, and makes them diſtil on the parts as a ſweet dew; now this cauſeth many different impreſſions on the Senſes: For the ſpirits which are driven with force, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate themſelves one on the other cauſe a troubleſome ſentiment to nature, and rather provoke it then flatter it; but thoſe which diſperſe themſelves as themſelves, and ſweetly inſinuate themſelves into the parts, tickle and content it: Conſidering that in thoſe Paſſions which have ill for their object, the ſpirits keep themſelves united &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to aſſault or flee from it; whence it is that they are piercing, and offend the parts they light on; but in Joy, wherin they dilate themſelves to embrace the good
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47499:103"/>it muſt needs blunt their point, and make them loſe the impetuoſity they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; So that what effuſion ſoever there is in Anger and in Grief, its never accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with pleaſure, becauſe it is not like that which is with Joy; to avow this, we muſt onely conſult the countenance of a joyful man; for you will finde therein I know not what kinde of a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vivacity, a clearer and purer ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and a ſweeter heat then in all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions we have made mention of; by reaſon that the purity of the ſpirits is not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe ſharp and darkſome fumes which are raiſed in the reſt, and that their motion is more free, more equal, and more conformable to their nature; it might be asked whether this effuſion of ſpirits be onely made in thoſe places where Good is preſented to the ſoul; and truly its there only neceſſary for it, ſince they onely diſperſe themſelves to poſſeſs this good, and that good toucheth it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where but where it makes it ſelf known; yet it is true that it abundantly pours them into the intrails, and that when Joy is high, there is no part which it over-flowes not; for which cauſe the heart and the lungs looſen themſelves as <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
                           <pb n="171" facs="tcp:47499:103"/>ſays, we are ſenſible of I know not what pleaſing emotion which moves all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts, and a ſweet heat and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, which diſperſeth it ſelf through the whole body: Now this happens according to my opinion, from that the ſenſitive ſoul hath not always a clear and certain knowledge of its object, and being charmed by that of Joy, ſhe fancies that ſhe ought everywhere to encounter it, and that ſhe ough alſo to ſend ſpirits every way to entertain it: or rather the urgency which preſſeth her forwards to the quick enjoyment of the preſented good, is the reaſon ſhe drives them on all ſides, without choice or order, or ſo much as diſcerning the places whether they are to move.</p>
                        <p>This ſhall ſuffice for the knowledge of the Motion of the ſpirits in Joy; in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the examen we have already made in the Treatiſe of Love. But one difficulty remaines which the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hath bred, and whoſe reſolution will give ſome light to the obſcurity of this matter; for we have ſaid, that the ſpirits are not agitated here with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and that their motion is always ſweet and calm; although this ſeem not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47499:104"/>to agree with the tranſports, the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the exceſſes which are ſo common in this Paſſion, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived without a violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſpirits: And in effect, when we compared this motion with that which is made in Love, we were not afraid to ſay, that they were driven in Joy as a great wave, and that it ſeemed then as if the ſoul would caſt it ſelf wholly and all at once before its object: So that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to be done without violence, and having certified that there was none in the effuſion of the ſpirits, we cannot eſcape the reproach to have ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Truth, and againſt Our Selves.</p>
                        <p>Yet it is very eaſie to anſwer this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, remembring, that Joy and Love are inſeparable; and that theſe two Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions being for that cauſe often conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if they were but one onely, theſe Motions were alſo confounded with their effects: ſo that Love drawing the ſpirits from the heart, and driving them out, we commonly ſay, that Joy alſo tranſports them. And as this motion is made with violence, and cauſeth troubleſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, the ſame thing may be ſaid of Joy: For thus we diſcourſed of it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47499:104"/>Chapter, where we did not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely compare Love with Joy, but onely the love of Beauty with the love of other things wherein Joy cauſeth faintings and ſyncopes, confounding, as commonly they do, theſe two Paſſions in one: But here, where we make an exact Anatomy of them, we ſeparate the motions of the one from the other; and conclude, that the tranſport of the ſpirits towards Good, is a particular effect of Love; and that the effuſion which follows it, is that of Joy: So that if there be violence in the firſt motion, it proceeds all from Love; Pleaſure hath no ſhare in it; and how impetuous ſoever it be, it muſt break and ſoften it ſelf, when the ſpirits begin to diſperſe themſelves; otherwiſe Joy would deſtroy it ſelf, by that troubleſome ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs which that impetuous and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion would excite in the parts.</p>
                        <p>Yet it follows not, that becauſe this effuſion is not violent and impetuous, it muſt be made ſlowly: for the ſpirits are ſuch ſtirring and ſubtil bodies, that they without reſiſtance penetrate everywhere: and their motions are ſo quick, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Nature could be found to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to, but Light: and it is by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47499:105"/>that alſo that we can make appear how they diſperſe themſelves in Joy: For it in a moment inſinuates it ſelf in Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous bodies without violence, and without confuſion runs thorow all their parts; without conſtraint dilates and extends it ſelf: and we might ſay, that had theſe bodies any knowledge, they would be ſenſible of an extreme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in that ſweet, although ſudden effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Light. So is it with that which is made in Joy: for after the ſoul hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſpirits towards its Good, and that ſhe believes ſhe hath united them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe leaves that preſſing, that diſquiet and precipitation which ſhe cauſed before that ſhe might arrive there: and, thinking ſhe can then with ſecurity enjoy the good ſhe poſſeſſeth, ſhe with liberty dilates her ſelf, without hinderance extends her ſelf, and in an inſtant penetrates all the parts of her object; cauſing the ſpirits to move in the ſame manner, which ſhe findes always obedient to her command. It is true, that in purſuit thereof there is a great diſſipation of them made, which the ſoul takes no care to repair, being wholly employed in the enjoyment of the good ſhe purſued, and being as it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47499:105"/>were charmed and raviſhed with her good fortune; whence thoſe weakneſſes follow, thoſe faintings, and thoſe other actions, of which we have already ſpoken.</p>

                        <head>PART. 4. <hi>The cauſes of the Characters of</hi> Joy.</head>
                        <p>YOu have ſeen what we had to ſay of the nature of this Paſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we enquire the cauſes of thoſe Characters which make it appear. Let us then now examine firſt the Moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and enquire why Joy is ſo talkative, ſo vain, and ſo credulous; why it confides ſo much in it ſelf, why it makes it ſelf to be defired, even when it is preſent, and why it is ſo ſoon weary of the Good which begot it: For theſe are the moſt obſervable effects which it produceth in the Minde, and whence it ſeems the reſt proceed. Let us ſeek then the cauſes of its <hi>Prattle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are Paſſions which will always ſpeak, and others which love to be ſilent. Silence commonly accompanies grief, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and fear: Joy, boldneſs and anger,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47499:106"/>and generally, all thoſe which move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Good, or reſiſt Ill, are given to Talk; but none ſo much as Joy: all the reſt ſeem to drive out their words, and caſt them forth with violence, as if they were a burden which the ſoul would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; this diſpenſeth them with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, makes them flow with pleaſure; and we may ſay, that it is rather abundance then conſtraint which ſends them forth. Indeed, Joy is full of babble, is pleaſed to talk, and always findes wherewith to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain its chat.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon hereof is eaſie enough to be diſcovered, if you conſider, that words being the images of the thoughts, to ſay many things, divers thoughts muſt form themſelves in the Minde; that they muſt have liberty to iſſue; that the organs muſt be diſpoſed to expreſs them. Now as Imagination is the ſource of the thoughts, and that it is more or leſs fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, according as it is more or leſs active; and that all its vivacity depends from that of the ſpirits which ſerve it in its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: it is neceſſary for great talkers, that the ſpirits ſhould be extremely active, and that the organs of the ſpeech ſhould be very moveable: And therefore, ſince it is
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47499:107"/>heat which renders the ſpirits active, and that humidity renders the body ſupple and pliable; theſe two qualities muſt be found in thoſe who ſpeak much: And beſides, the Judgement muſt not be ſo ſtrong as the Imagination, that it may not ſeverely examine the thoughts, that it may not withhold them, but that they may all freely vent themſelves. This is the reaſon why young folks and women, the ſanguine and the flegmatick, talk more then others; why wine, good chear, and folly, provoke talk ſo much; and why birds moſt commonly ſing when they wooe, becauſe being naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to get their young ones, their blood works, and becomes fumy, their ſpirits increaſe and kindle, and afterwards agitate the Imagination and the organs of the voice.</p>
                        <p>Which being ſuppoſed, it is eaſie to know why theſe Paſſions which move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Good, or reſiſt Ill, cauſe us to ſpeak more then the others do; Becauſe in the deſigne they have to go out, the Spirits muſt carry themſelves to the Brain, and to the exteriour parts, which augments the heat, and diſperſeth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, &amp; in purſuit moves the Imagination,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47499:107"/>and makes the organs beoom more move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: So that all theſe diſpoſitions meeting with the weakneſs of the Judgement, which accompanies all the Paſſions, a great flood of words muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low there: And chiefly in Joy, ſince by it the Soul dilates and diffuſeth it ſelf, and that there is nothing whereby it can more diſperſe it then by ſpeech, which is the true flowing of the thoughts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Imagination is freer in this Paſſion then in the reſt, in which either the abſence of the good or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ill conſtrain it, and involve it in cares which it hath not in Joy, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing its good with ſecurity and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without diſtraction, and without finding any obſtacle to ſtop its concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or hinder the iſſue of them.</p>
                        <p>For what concerns <hi>Confidence,</hi> as 'tis a Paſſion which perſwades us that ill is far from us, and that although it ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf, we have power enough to overcome it; we need not doubt but thoſe who are joyful and content, are of the ſame belief, being in poſſeſſion of Good: For Good hath that property, that by its preſence it eſtrangeth ill, and fortifies the ſoul in the enjoyment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47499:108"/>becauſe that in perfecting of it, it in ſome manner increaſeth it, &amp; makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare greater &amp; more vigorous then it was: Conſidering that being wholly occupied and raviſhed in the enjoyment of Good, and not minding thoſe difficulties which may traverſe its deſignes, it truſts that it can have no ill ſucceſs: and filling it ſelf thus with good hopes, it believes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes all, and nothing ſeems difficult unto it. But what foments its audacity the more, 'tis the heat it ſtirs up in all the parts: For, as this quality is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all the vigour they have, the Soul, which perceives how ſhe hath enlarged her ſelf, perſwades her ſelf that her ſtrength is alſo increaſed, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagines that ſhe is the more ſecure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much affiſtance both to aſſault and reſiſt Ill. Now becauſe this vain Confidence is a kinde of Pride, which lifts up the Minde above it ſelf, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it with an imaginary excellency, thence it happens that the Joy thereof is commonly <hi>Inſolent</hi> and <hi>Preſumptuous,</hi> that it loves to be flattered, and eaſily falls into the praiſes of it ſelf, being, as it is, ſo babling, and ſo greedy to expreſs it ſelf.</p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:47499:108"/>
                        <p>Yet, this preſumption hinders it not from being <hi>Complacent, Facile,</hi> and <hi>Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;</hi> although pride render men opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and untractable; becauſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining it ſelf but with the vain hopes it conceives, and juſtling onely thoſe which oppoſe them; it willingly hears thoſe which favour them, and is eaſily perſwaded by their flattery; its confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence making it fancy all things poſſible; beſides the poſſeſſion it hath of good, is that which produceth and foments it; it follows the qualities of good, which is to communicate it ſelf; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently renders it ſelf ſociable, eaſie, and complacent.</p>
                        <p>But how can joy leave in the ſoul a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of it ſelf,</hi> ſeeing it is there preſent; and that it ſeems it is a thing incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with that ſatiety which we ſaid it brought? To reſolve this difficulty, we muſt ſuppoſe that pleaſure may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent two manner of ways, when it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally toucheth the ſoul, or when memory calls it back to the thoughts; neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily begetting deſire; foraſmuch as its conceived as a thing which is no more, and which yet leaves in the memory all thoſe allurements which render it deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47499:109"/>the other being actually preſent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in that reſpect be wiſhed for; for, that deſire moves only towards thoſe things which we have not; but onely then what we conceive ſomething which we do not yet poſſeſs: as when we deſire the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of it, or that the delightful object doth not wholly, or all at once preſent it ſelf to our knowledge; and then what remains to be poſſeſt, entertains and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the deſire.</p>
                        <p>Now the object preſents it ſelf not all at once, either by its own defect, or by that of the power which receives it; for there are things which we cannot enjoy but by a ſucceſſion of time, and which muſt be ſeveral times retaken, to get an entire and perfect poſſeſſion of them. Thus an excellent diſcourſe, a ſweet muſick le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, the delight of eating and drinking, require time and ſeveral repetitions to be throughly poſſeſt: But there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo which depend not on time, and yet wherein the ſoul muſt employ it, to have a perfect enjoyment of them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by reaſon of the difficulties it meets, as in the enquiry of Sciences; or by reaſon of their excellency that they cannot all at once be comprehended, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47499:109"/>wherein it always findes new ſubjects of admiration: Such is the knowledge which we have here below of Divine things, which cauſe that torrent of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to flow into the will, which never quencheth its drought, and always leaves it an ardent thirſt, which even Eternity it ſelf cannot quench.</p>
                        <p>Thus ſee you have how Pleaſure can beget deſire; let us now ſee how it can cauſe <hi>Satiety;</hi> It is evident, that things may ſatisfie two wayes, either when they no longer flatter the Senſes with pleaſure, or when they diſguſt them; Falſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as thoſe of the Senſes, become diſtaſtful and importunate; becauſe they are not abſolutely convenient for nature, they ſurpaſs the natural capacity of the powers, and their uſe weakens and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the organs: but thoſe which are pure and true do never diſguſt, becauſe they never exceed the natural reach of the Soul, but they perfect it, and inſtead of burthening and weaking, they eaſe and fortifie it: It is true, they may give a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, becauſe the minde being a lover of novelty, and finding it no longer in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereto it hath long applied it ſelf, it alſo findes not that ſatisfaction which it
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47499:110"/>took at the begining, and ſeeks by change to nouriſh its deſire and inclination. But we have ſpoken enough of theſe things wherewith Moral Philoſophy is full; let us examine the Characters which Joy imprints on the Body.</p>
                        <p>Of all the many Characters which Joy imprints on the body, There are the looks onely, the ſerenity of the forehead, Laughter, Careſſes, and diſquiet, which are cauſed by the Souls command; all the reſt happen without her thought, and have no other cauſe but the agitation of the humors which neceſſarily produce thoſe effects.</p>
                        <p>For the Looks, there are three kindes common to this Paſſion, for it renders them ſweet, dying, and unquiet; we will ſay, what is the cauſe of theſe laſt, when we ſpeak of the diſquiet, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience which appears in all its other actions.</p>
                        <p>The Looks are <hi>ſweet,</hi> either becauſe they are modeſt, or becauſe they are laughing; and theſe are proper to Joy, which cauſeth the lids to fall a little, and contract themſelves; and which fills the eyes with a certain pleaſant ſplendor. Now this ſplendor comes from the ſpirits
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47499:110"/>which arrive in thoſe parts; and the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lids is effected by ſmiling, and by the deſign which the ſoul hath to preſerve the image of the deſirable object, as we ſhewed in ſeeking the cauſes of amorous Looks; ſo that we have onely theſe which are called <hi>dying,</hi> which require a long examen.</p>
                        <p>We have already ſaid in the diſcourſe of Love, that they were called ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe which dye caſt forth the like, lifting up their eyes on high, and half hiding them under their lids. But that ſeems very difficult to conceive, that Looks which accompany Languor, Grief, and Death, ſhould be found in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>Yet as there are ſeveral things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which have common effects, becauſe they have common cauſes; it may alſo be that this kinde of Look findes the ſame cauſe in Grief, and in Joy, in the pangs of Death, as in the raviſhment of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Let us then examine the reaſons why they are to be found in theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Paſſions, that we may ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any which may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to Joy. Firſt we need not doubt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47499:111"/>but Grief lifts up the eyes on high, and looks up to heaven, as the place whence it expects help to drive away the ill which afflicts it: For Nature hath given that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and inclination to man, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſuperiour powers, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves himſelf abandoned by the reſt: So that without minding it, his mouth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes them, his eyes turn towards them, and his arms are lifted up to crave their aſſiſtance. It alſo happens that this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which would flee the ill which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf, gathering up within it ſelf, draws along with it all the more move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able parts, and ſo retires the eyes in, as if it thought to hide it ſelf, by hiding thoſe organs whence ſhe ſeems moſt to ſhew her ſelf. Or rather, it comes from that the parts, being void of ſpirits, which the force of Grief diſſipated or tranſported elſewhere, they of themſelves repoſſeſs their natural ſituation, which is to be a little lifted up: For it is certain, that the ſituation of the parts, when they reſt, is more natural then that which they have in action, wherein there is always ſome kinde of conſtraint: And we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently believe, that the eyes which take that ſite in ſleeping, ſeek it as the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47499:111"/>moſt calm, and moſt natural for them: So that it ſeems the looks become dying in Grief, as they do in Sleep by the flight of the ſpirits which leave the eyes to their reſt. Death may alſo cauſe this effect, by the convulſion which often accompanies it, and which makes the nerves retire to their origine; or, by reaſon of weakneſs, cannot retain the parts in that tenſion which their action requires; ſo that the lids fall, and the eyes are lifted up, taking again, as we have ſaid, their natural ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of all theſe cauſes, there is onely the gathering up of the Soul, and the drawing back of the Spirits, which are to be found in Joy, and from whence theſe dying looks may take their birth: for they have no aſſiſtance to implore, nor convulſion to fear. But in the tranſport which the enjoyment of Good gives the Soul, it often quits the exteriour parts, gathers the ſpirits inwardly together, or carries them elſewhere; and ſo forſaking the eyes, leaves them the liberty to regain their natural ſituation, which makes them appear languiſhing and dying.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Forehead is ſerene,</hi> when it is ſmoothe and without wrinkles; and this ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes from that all the muſcles are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47499:112"/>extended, and equally draw it out on every ſide; or from that they are all at reſt, and leave it in its ordinary ſituation. Now it ſeems that Joy cauſeth a ſerenity of the forehead in both manners: For it is certain, that as it hath the property to dilate and diſperſe the ſoul and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it ſeeks to do the ſame in all the parts of the body: So that becauſe the muſcles cannot move but by contracting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it never intends to move thoſe of the forehead, ſince it would cauſe a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary to its deſigne, chiefly, their action being not neceſſary in this encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that of the eyes might be, and of the tongue, and of others which it agitates in this Paſſion for particular reaſons. The Forehead then remains calm, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contracting it ſelf. On the contrary, it ſeems to open, and on all ſides to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf, by reaſon of the ſpirits which rarifie the parts, and makes them appear the larger. Yet becauſe that in Laughter the forehead becomes ſmoothe by the ſtretching of the muſcles, which equally draw it upwards and downwards, it might ſeem that Joy which cauſeth Laughter, cauſed alſo that tenſion, and brought that ſerenity to the forehead as well by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47499:112"/>moving as by ſlacking the muſcles. But in the following Diſcourſe we will ſhew, that it is not Joy which produceth that effect, but the Surprize, which is the true cauſe of Laughter. 'Tis not but that the Soul without that Surprize may extend the forehead, by contracting the muſcles; but then it is a feigned and forced ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that of Flatterers, of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that the Forehead is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is to ſay, ſtretched, and not contracted, as the Tranſlators have explained it: for it is the Muſcles which are contracted, but the Forehead which is extended and made ſmoothe by their contraction.</p>
                        <p>All <hi>Careſſes</hi> are not properly effects of Joy: Take but away the ſerenity of the countenance, the ſmile, and the ſweetneſs of the eyes, the reſt proceed from the Paſſion of Love, which ſubjects the ſoul to the good which it conceives, and fills it with a deſire to poſſeſs it: For the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of ſervice, reſpectful complements and civilities, are ſo many marks of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which it renders to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and excellency of the perſon it loves: and the embraces, kiſſes, and amorous looks, are witneſſes of its deſire, and of the care it takes to unite it ſelf thereunto.</p>

                        <p>For <hi>Laughter,</hi> although it ſeem to be a particular effect of Joy, yet it is not always to be found with it: And when it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it, it ows not its birth to it alone: there are other cauſes which contribute thereunto, and which excite an emotion in the Soul quite different from that of Pleaſure. So that we were not afraid to call it a Paſſion; not conſidering the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motion onely which appears on the face, but that which the ſoul inwardly ſuffers, the nature and effects whereof we will examine in the following Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
                        <p>There remains now the <hi>Diſquiet</hi> and <hi>Impatience</hi> onely, whoſe cauſes we are to enquire. But we muſt firſt obſerve, that they are not in all kinde of Joy: there are calm Pleaſures, wherein the ſoul feels nothing of Impatience; wherein we may ſay, ſhe reſts in her motion. Such are thoſe which accompany the exerciſe of Vertue, the knowledge of the Sciences, and the poſſeſſion of Supernatural good. In a word, pure and true Delights do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſquiet the ſoul; they always leave a calm, and a pleaſing ſerenity: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they often moves deſires which agitate it, we may ſay, they are little
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47499:113"/>windes which purifie it without cauſing any ſtorms; or, that they are like thoſe ſweet ſmoaks which the flame raiſeth, which nouriſh it in ſtead of diſſipating it, and which rather entertain the equality of its motion, then diſturb it. But it is not ſo with falſe delights: As by little and little they make themſelves felt and ſeen as a remedy for grief, there muſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they are wholly poſſeſt, always remain ſomewhat which is diſpleaſing in the Minde. And then you cannot wonder if Impatience accompany the deſires it hath to be delivered from it, and to ſee it ſelf enjoying that perfect pleaſure wherein the end of its grief conſiſts. But it foreſees not that its contentment is to finiſh there alſo, and that aſſoon as it hath an entire poſſeſſion of the Good it ſeeks, it will be diſguſted: So that being not to be ſatisfied, it cannot but ſuffer perpetual diſquiets; ſeeking what it cannot finde, and meeting what it never ſought. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all theſe vain hopes which Joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires, breed divers deſignes: and as it runs from one to another, without ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at any, it is impoſſible, in this agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that all its actions muſt appear uuquiet, its diſcourſe without order, its
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47499:114"/>looks inconſtant, &amp; all the body in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion; whereunto alſo the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſpirits contributes, which tickles the nerves and ſollicities the parts to move themſelves; conſidering alſo that thoſe Pleaſures cannot be had, but by the action of the corporal powers which at laſt tire themſelves, diſquiet muſt accompany them, ſince its an effect of weariſomeneſs.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the Characters which Joy imprints in the body by the ſouls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Now let us ſee thoſe which are cauſed without her ardors, and which by a neceſſary conſequence, proceed from the agitation which is made in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and in the ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>vivacity of the eyes</hi> comes from their ſplendor and motion, which are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſignes of life and vigour, ſince death renders them obſcure and fixt: as the Spirits then diſperſe themſelves in Joy, and as they are luminous and active, the eyes which abundantly receive them, and which are tranſparent, and eaſie to move, become agile and reſplendent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the humidity which is ſpred over them, being agitated by the motion they make, the light becomes more trembling,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47499:114"/>and cauſeth a certain moving luſter, which ſtrikes the ſight with ſeveral rays, and preſents to the imagination the motion and noiſe which the ſparkes of fire cauſe at their birth whence they are ſaid to crackle: Now this <hi>humidity</hi> may come from two cauſes; either becauſe the lids in ſhutting themſelves cruſh the humors they contain, and render the eyes moiſt; as we will more particularly ſhew in the diſcourſe of Laughter; Or becauſe that heat and the ſpirits open their paſſages, and diſſolve thoſe humors, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward runs on the parts and make them moiſt: nay even if the brain be very moiſt, thence they draw rivulets of tears, which are as they ſay quite different from thoſe which Grief uſeth to move, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their cauſe, but even in their quality; for they are cold in Joy, and hot in grief, although it ſeems as if the contrary ſhould happen, ſince Joy heats, and Grief cooles; and that hath even obliged ſome to ſay, that the teares of Joy were warm; but it is eaſie to agree, and give a reaſon for the difference; by ſaying, that the tears which Joy ſheds, are truely cold in compariſon of others; but that they ſeem colder, becauſe they run down a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47499:115"/>face which that Paſſion hath heated by the effuſion of ſpirits: On the contrary, thoſe of Grief are colder in effect; but as they fall on the cheekes, which the flight of ſpirits hath deprived of heat, they ſeem to be hotter; in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as hot water affoords divers ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hot and cold, according as the hand is hotter or colder. But of this more exactly hereafter in the diſcourſe you have of Tears.</p>
                        <p>For that <hi>redneſs, that good caſe, and that vaporous heat</hi> which appears through the outward parts, they alſo proceed from that effuſion of ſpirits, which draw along with them the blood, and the ſweeteſt vapours which raiſe themſelves in the veins, and ſwell the parts they arrive at, colouring them vermillion, and inſpiring them with a ſweet and moiſt heat.</p>
                        <p>The trembling <hi>of the lips</hi> comes alſo from the Spirits, which abundantly flowing into thoſe parts which are ſoft and ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, agitate them with the motion they have, and make them appear trembling, as it happens to leaves which are ſhaken with the winde, or with rain.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>voice grows fuller,</hi> becauſe the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles which ſerve to form it are looſned
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47499:115"/>by heat, and give it a greater and larger paſſage; it is true; that it ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>ſhrill,</hi> but that is the effect of a vehement laughter, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the muſcles, &amp; ſtreightens, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit of the voice; or elſe of impatience, or ſome other impetuous Paſſions which mingle themſelves with it, and oblige the ſoul to drive it out with violence: it often <hi>ſtops it ſelf</hi> all at once by the ſouls raviſhment, which cauſeth it to forget the moſt part of its ordinary functions, and leaves the organs of the voice without motion, and without action.</p>
                        <p>In fine, it is from thence that all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vertues draw their force and vigour; for as they do not work but by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the ſpirits, when they come and ſhed themſelves on the organs, they muſt neceſſarily grow ſtronger, and their functions muſt be done more perfectly: ſo there are no ill humours which may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the purity of the blood, ſeeing the vertue which concocts them is always miſtris of them, and that which expels them findes them obedient: for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits melt them and ſend them to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and open the paſſages to let them out: So that it is true, there is no Paſſion
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47499:116"/>which is ſo great friend to health as Joy, ſo as it be moderate: for if it be exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, it changeth all natural oeconomy, it quencheth the heat of the intrails, and at laſt by <hi>Mortal Syncopes,</hi> or by <hi>incurable languors,</hi> it cauſes even the loſs of our lives. We have already touched the Reaſons in the former Diſcourſe, where we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Love and Joy carried the ſpirits abroad with precipitation; it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that in the violence of that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port they loſe the union which they ſhould have with their principle, whence follow Faintings and Syncopes. For I doe not eſteem that the diſſipation of the Spirits, as is commonly ſaid, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe of thoſe actions, ſince ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny watchings, ſo many toyles, ſo many ſickneſſes, which diſſipate them more then any Paſſion whatſoever, cauſe not theſe ſad Symptomes; but according to my opinion it comes from that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite, and ſeparate themſelves from the heart; and that the Soul being unable to animate the ſeparated parts, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any vertue to them, the actions which they ought to do muſt ceaſe by this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which the vehemency of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cauſed. This is the cauſe why water
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47499:116"/>caſt on the face, oft-times puts away thoſe faintings, and ſends back the ſtraggling ſpirits to the heart, which would not be, were they quite loſt: It is not but that here they make a great diſſipation, as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly diſperſe themſelves on all the parts, and principally on the outward; and the ſoul, which is wholly occupied in the enjoyment of good, takes no care to continue the courſe; and to produce new ones, it muſt neceſſarily make a great loſs of them, and conſequently, natural heat muſt diminiſh; whence comes weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the languiſhing of the parts, the corruption of the humours, corroding diſeaſes, and at laſt death. It might be demanded, why Joy cauſeth death rather then Love or Anger: but we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this in the particular diſcourſe of the Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>There remains nothing now but the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heart, of the Arteries, and of Reſpiration</hi> to be examined, which are all alike in this; that they are great, rare, ſlow, and without vehemency, unleſs this Paſſion be exceſſive; for then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come little, weak and frequent, and even often they quite ceaſe to be. The hearts motion then is rare and flow, becauſe the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47499:117"/>heat is not vehement, having ſent it with the ſpirits towards the outward parts. So that having no need of any great refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it haſts not ſo much to move; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that alſo the ſoul, which is raviſhed in the enjoyment of good, minds not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, but as it is urged by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; whence it comes that it moves ſlowly, and with great intervalls. But to ſupply its negligence, it every time very much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and extends it, recompencing its neglect by the greatneſs of its motion. Now becauſe there muſt be always ſome vigour, thus to open and extend that part, when the violence of the Paſſion hath diſſipated its forces, the motion of the heart muſt become weak and little, and the neceſſity it hath to move for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of ſpirits, renders it quick and frequent, becauſe it cannot ſupply its ſlowneſs by the greatneſs of the motion: So that if the weakneſs be extreme, it loſeth alſo its ſwiftneſs, and ſo becomes ſlow and rare, and at laſt quite ceaſeth. The ſame is done in the Pulſe, and in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; for they have the ſame cuſtoms, and the ſame cauſes with the hearts moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Phyſick teacheth us.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>The Characters of</hi> Laughter.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know not why <hi>Socrates</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, that Man was a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous creature: But I know, if any reaſon can make it credible, we need go no further to ſeek it, then in Laughter it ſelf; ſince there is nothing ſo ridiculous, as to ſee him who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to control all Nature, and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves himſelf to be her Confident, to be ignorant of what is moſt proper and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to him; To laugh at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without knowing wherefore; and to know neither the ſubjects nor the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which form this Paſſion. For all the great men of the paſt ages, which have enquired the cauſes thereof, have freely confeſs'd that their mindes were incapable of that knowledge; remitting
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47499:118"/>us to that Philoſopher who laughed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; and that it was hid in the ſame depth wherein he had encloſed the Truth.</p>
                     <p>Now although we do not think our ſelves clearer ſighted then they, yet our deſigne having obliged us to handle this Subject, we are conſtrained to go beyond them, and to undertake a thing wherein they loſt their courage. But what ſucceſs ſoever we have, the Diſcourſe cannot but divert and pleaſe us: for, if it do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the nature of Laughter, yet it will at leaſt augment the number of ridiculous things.</p>
                     <p>To begin therefore according to the Order we have hitherto obſerved, we muſt firſt draw the picture thereof, and then enquire the cauſes which produce it.</p>
                     <p>Now as it may be weak, mean, or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is certain that we are chiefly to obſerve the Characters of the later, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in all kinde of things the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is always to be the meaſure of the Leſſer, becauſe its effects are more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the others: nay, we may even ſay, that there are no Paſſions, how violent ſoever, which cauſe ſuch great alterations in the body as this doth.</p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:47499:118"/>
                     <p>For if you conſider the Face; The Forehead extends it ſelf, the Eye brows decline themſelves, the Lids contract themſelves at the corners of the eyes; and all the ſkin about them becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even, and wrinkles it ſelf all over: the Eyes extenuate and half ſhut themſelves; they grow ſparkling and humid; and even thoſe from which Grief could never draw a tear, are then obliged to weep: the Noſe crumples up, and grows ſharp; the Lips retire, and lengthen themſelves; the Teeth diſcover themſelves; the Cheeks lift themſelves up, &amp; grow more firm; and ſometimes the middle of them ſweetly hollows it ſelf, and forms thoſe delightful pits wherein the Poets lodg'd Laughter with the Graces: the Mouth, which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to open it ſelf, diſcovers the trembling and ſuſpended Tongue; and the Voice which iſſues, is nothing but a piercing and interrupted ſound, which cannot be ſtopped, &amp; which ends onely with the loſs of our breath: the Neck ſwells, and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens it ſelf; all the Veins are great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; a certain ſweet ſplendor diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelf over all the face; and how pale or ſevere ſoever it be, it muſt needs grow red, and appear content.</p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:47499:119"/>
                     <p>But all this is nothing in compariſon of what the other parts ſuffer: The Breſt is ſo impetuouſly agitated, and with ſuch ſuddenly-redoubled ſhakes, that we can hardly breathe, that we loſe the uſe of ſpeech, and that it is impoſſible to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low whatſoever it be. So preſſing a pain riſeth in the Flanks, that it ſeems as if the intrails were torn, and that they would unfold themſelves. In this violence, we ſee all the body bend, and wreathe, and gather it ſelf together. The Hands are ſet on the ſides, and preſs them forcibly; ſweat gets up in the Face; the Voice is loſt in hickocks, and the Breath in ſtifled ſighs. Sometimes this agitation gets to ſo high an exceſs, that it produceth the ſame effects as Medicaments do, that it puts the Bones out of joynt, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſyncopes, and in fine, that it gives death. The Head and the Arms ſuffer the ſame throws with the breſt and the flanks; but you may perceive how in theſe motions they throw themſelves here and there with precipitation and diſorder; and that after they have been caſt from one ſide to the other, as if they had loſt all their vigour. The Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come feeble, the Legs cannot ſupport
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47499:119"/>themſelves, and the body is conſtrained to fall.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the principal parts which uſually form vehement Laughter: For, to deſcribe all the diverſity of motions, air, mine, and the poſture it puts every one in, were as much as if one would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate all Men at once: ſince there is not one who in laughing makes not ſome particular face; And it is certain, that there are as many kindes of laughter as there are different faces. Even that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſound which accompanies it, is ſo divers, that two men are hardly to be found, who ſhall have it every way alike.</p>
                     <p>For the Mean Laughter, it cauſeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame alteration in the face, and agitates the breſt and the flanks in the ſame manner as vehement Laughter; but 'tis with far leſs violence. It alſo takes not away reſpiration nor ſpeech; it onely renders the voice groſſer. Even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it cauſeth it to paſs the noſtrils, and make an interrupted bellowing. Neither doth it cauſe grief or languor in the parts, or any of thoſe troubleſome accidents which are in the other.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the Smile, which is the weakeſt &amp; the leaſt of all, cauſeth no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47499:120"/>but in the face, and chiefly on the lips and eyes: for the lids a little contract themſelves, the eyes ſweeten, and the lips lengthen out themſelves, without obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the mouth to open, and without changing either the voice or ſpeech: Even often it is onely obſervable in the lips, as when it comes from diſdain, or from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, or from ſome ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>To diſcover then the ſource of all theſe motions, we muſt firſt ſee what thoſe things are which move us to Laughter: for, being as the Object and the Matter, they are alſo the firſt Cauſes which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its birth. Yet is it not a thing ſo eaſily determined. And it ſeems as if Nature would render it ſelf ridiculous in ridiculous things, having made them ſo far diſtant the one from the other, and ſo different amongſt themſelves, that it is almoſt impoſſible to finde any general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or common reaſon, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them under one kinde.</p>
                     <p>For we ſee that Laughter comes from pleaſant and facetious actions and words, from admiration, deſpight, ſcorn, careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, tickling, and even from ſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. And as at firſt it ſeems as if there were no relation between all theſe things,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47499:120"/>we may eaſily believe that Laughter is an equivocal word, which marks effects of a different nature; and that that which comes from the moſt part of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is feigned and lying, and hath no real form of Laughter.</p>
                     <p>In effect, all thoſe who have ſpoken of it, have placed them under divers kindes; ſome more, ſome leſs, according to the ſeveral motives of that Laughter which they fancied in ridiculous objects: (I take here the word ridiculous, for all what moves Laughter.) Now becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this difficulty wholly depends on the knowledge of this motive, and that it is impoſſible to diſcern true Laughter, or thoſe objects which are truely ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if we know not the principle, and the reaſon why it moves it; we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the opinions which have been on this Subject, that we may chuſe the moſt reaſonable, which may ſerve for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know the nature and the effects of this Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt firſt obſerve, that Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is made by the convulſion of the muſcles of the face, was never taken by any for a true Laughter, being a thing againſt Nature, whereto the Will never
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47499:121"/>contributed, as it doth in all other things: Such perhaps is that which ſucceeds the wounds of the Diaphragma, and that which that herb of Sardinia cauſeth, which is called <hi>Apium riſus,</hi> whence the Proverb is of the Sardinian laughter. Even they ſay that Saffron, the Tarantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, and ſome other Potions, produce the ſame effect. But perhaps the Laughter which is cauſed by theſe later, is no true convulſion, no more then that which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in doatings, and in the fits of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that it may have the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as true Laughter hath, as you will ſee hereafter.</p>
                     <p>This being ſuppoſed, we might at firſt ſuſpect, that thoſe objects which cauſe Laughter, are thoſe which are pleaſing and delightful; becauſe that Laughter and Tears being contrary, they muſt have contrary cauſes; and therefore that Laughter comes from Joy, ſince Tears proceed from Grief. In effect, it ſeems that Laughter is never ſeparate from Pleaſure; and even thoſe who force themſelves to laugh, endeavour always to appear merry and contented. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all pleaſing things do not move Laughter, that even it happens not when
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47499:121"/>Joy is at the higheſt; and that Beaſts, which are affected with that Paſſion, are not capable of Laughter; we muſt hold it for undoubted, that that then is not the general motive, and that the Reaſons to maintain this opinion do onely prove that the objects ought onely to be pleaſing, but not that they are therefore ridiculous. And if Scorn and Indignation cauſe a true Laughter, it is moſt likely that accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and pleaſure are not always to be found with it.</p>
                     <p>This conſideration hath made ſome think that Admiration was the cauſe of Laughter, and that when any wonderful thing preſented it ſelf to our Mindes, it at the ſame time formed this Paſſion; and that for that cauſe Man onely laughed, becauſe there was none but he that admired; That facetious words and actions were ridiculous, becauſe they are new, and that Novelty is the ſource of Admiration; That, in fine, ignorants and fools laughed more then wiſe men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they finde more things to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then they did. But although at firſt this opinion take the Minde, yet doth it not ſatisfie it; and hath its difficulties as well as the former: For, there are divers
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47499:122"/>things wonderful, and which we admire, which do not make us laugh: even if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration be very great, it hinders Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And it is to no purpoſe to ſay that it ought to be mean and light to move it, ſince it often happens that we laugh at thoſe things which we very much admire. Indeed, the addreſs which a facetious man hath to repreſent the actions, the words, the geſtures of another, to tell jeſts, to make ſubtil and ingenious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, is no leſs to be admired then that of a Painter who makes ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſigne, or of a man who ſeriouſly relates very fine things: Why then doth the admiration which that cauſeth, excite Laughter, and that of this hinder it? Are there not an hundred kinde of things which are new, which are admired with mediocrity, as the moſt part of thoſe are which are rare, which yet cauſe not Laughter? On the contrary, are there not ſome which ſeem to have loſt the grace of a novelty, and which cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get admiration, which yet are ridiculous? He who tells a good tale, is often the firſt that laughs at it; and yet it is neither new nor admirable, ſeeing he knew it before. As there are then ridiculous things which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47499:122"/>are marvellous, and others which are not ſo, we muſt ſeek the cauſe elſewhere then in Admiration.</p>
                     <p>Many, to ſhun theſe difficulties, have joyned theſe two opinions together, and ſaid, that Joy and Admiration was the true motive of Laughter; and that if there are wonderful things which move it not, it is becauſe they are not agreeable, in the ſame manner as the agreeable are not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous unleſs they are marvellous. But it is certain, that the greateſt part of the inconveniences which we have obſerved, are herein alſo to be found; and that there are divers things which are pleaſing and wonderful, which never move Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Is there any thing ſo fair or ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable as the Sun? All the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of flowers and fruits which the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons bring us, all the treaſures which the earth affords us, all thoſe maſter-pieces wherewith Art furniſheth us, and all thoſe rarities which ſtrangers ſend us, Are they not delightful? do they not oblige us to admire them? Yet was never any body ſeen to laugh at the ſight of all theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Others have imagined that all theſe opinions might be maintained with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47499:123"/>that it was true, to ſpeak ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, Joy and Admiration did not cauſe Laughter, but when they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creative, that is to ſay, when they were not ſerious, and that they happened in Plays; then they move it; and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requiring theſe divertiſements to refreſh the Minde and the Body, and give them new forces, it by that exteriour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made the pleaſure appear which it there ſearched. But are there not Plays and divertiſements which do not cauſe Laughter? And ſhould we reduce them to facetious things, how ſhould we finde them in tickliſhneſs, in the encounter of friends, in indignation and in anger, and even in the admiration of ſerious things?</p>
                     <p>This is what the Philoſophers have left us touching ridiculous things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But ſince they do not ſatisfie us, let us ſee what the Poets and Orators have ſaid on the Subject: for the Ridiculous is the object of Comedy; and the Orator is ſometimes obliged to employ it in his Diſcourſes. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> muſt be conſulted about the buſineſs. The firſt, treating of Comedy, defined what was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to be A deformity without a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47499:123"/>grief. And truely it ſeems, that what we call Ridiculous, is an imperfection which in appearance cauſeth no ill to him who hath it: For, did we think it would cauſe any, it would not move Laughter, but Compaſſion. And this deformity is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in all what's done or ſaid againſt the cuſtom, expectation, or opinion of the Wiſe.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Cicero,</hi> he confeſſeth there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the ridiculous; but he will have another condition then that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved: For he ſays, that its Nature conſiſts in repreſenting ugly and deformed things with a good grace. And if there are words and actions to be found which delightfully diſcover the defects of others, they will infallibly move Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Opinions have without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon been followed or rejected by many Philoſophers. For thoſe who ſay it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends not all ridiculous things, and that there is no uglineſs or deformity at the firſt ſight in perſons which are dear unto us, in tickling, and in divers other ſerious things which make us laugh; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that an impertinent performs acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſcourſes with an ill grace,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47499:124"/>which are extremely ridiculous: Thoſe, I ſay, are deceived as well as others who in general ſeek the nature and eſſence of what is Ridiculous, binding themſelves to theſe definitions, as if they perfectly expreſt it, and perplexing their mindes to excuſe the defects they meet in them: for it is certain, that neither the one nor the other conſider the Ridiculous but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Stage or the Bar; that <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves that which befits an Orator, and that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> comprehends all the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Subjects which may ſerve in Comedy. So that the Objections made againſt them are vain and weak, foraſmuch as tickling belongs no ways to the Theatre, no more then impertinencies done with an ill grace are not admitted into the Rules of Oratory. And indeed, to ſhew you that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did not diſcourſe of the Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous like a Philoſopher, and that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not its eſſential form, he hath not mentioned thoſe deformities in thoſe places where he examined the cauſes of Laughter. And were we to ſuppoſe it, would it not be uſeleſs to know the nature of this Paſſion? What reaſon is there that an object ſhould move Laughter for being deformed without grief?</p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:47499:124"/>
                     <p>I know well that there are ſome who have ſaid that Laughter was compoſed of Grief and Joy; that that proceeds from deformity, as Joy comes from that it is without Grief; and that in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat which theſe two Paſſions give the Minde, are formed thoſe contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart, of the Diaphragma, and of the other parts, which appear in Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But what likelihood is there that Sorrow ſhould have a ſhare in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How can it cauſe a violent agitation, or ſubſiſt ſo long with that exceſs of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, being ſo little and ſo light as it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured? What Grief can we be ſenſible of at the meeting of perſons we love, in the relation of good news, or in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious encounter? And we muſt not ſay that the <hi>Smile,</hi> which theſe objects move, is no true Laughter: for the one differs not from the other, but in that one is greater or leſs; and we ſee every moment, that the ſame object moves Laughter in ſome, and but Smiles in others.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the moſt conſiderable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have been on this Subject, which in my opinion are all wanting, in that they ſuppoſe that there are divers kindes of ridiculous things and of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47499:125"/>and that there can no general noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be found, which can be equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them: for I cannot imagine that Nature, who is ſo regular and ſo uniform in all its other actions, ſhould forget it ſelf in this; that ſhe would give ſeveral cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to one effect; and that it being true that all kinde of Laughter hath ſomewhat that is common, the ſoul ſhould have no general motive for ſo common and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral an action.</p>
                     <p>We muſt then endeavour to diſcover it, and if we do not ſucceed, uſe the ſame excuſes which the difficulty of the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry afforded thoſe who made, it before us; ſince perhaps, there is nothing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whoſe knowledge is more hid, then that of this.</p>
                     <p>Whereunto that we may attain, we muſt firſt conſider: that we never laugh, but when the ſoul is in ſome manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and ſurpriſed; as may be ſeen in all the ridiculous actions which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls deformities without grief; ſince they are all againſt the cuſtome, againſt the expectation, and againſt the ſence of the Wiſe.</p>
                     <p>It is the ſame thing in the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected encounter of a pleaſing thing,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47499:125"/>and in an injury which we receive from a man we did beleeve ought not to offend us; in the good, or in the ill, which happens to thoſe who are worthy of it: For there is therein every way ſomewhat, which by its novelty ſurpriſeth the minde, which is to be found even in tickling; whence it comes to paſs, that we laugh not when we tickle our ſelves, becauſe we are not new, nor ſtrange to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Yet this ſurpriſe muſt be light; for if it be violent, it aſtoniſheth the minde, and ſo powerfully averts it, that it cannot go to the outward parts to make them move. So that objects which are very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and extremely pleaſing move us not to laughter, but to raviſhment and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, as terrible ones cauſe fear and aſtoniſhment; 'tis not that we ſay that the lighteſt ſurpriſe is that which moves laughter the more; it is onely to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, in compariſon of that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſheth or raviſheth the minde; for it is evident that the greater, ſo as it do not diſturb and carry away the ſpirit, will cauſe the more vehement laughter; making not only the muſcles of the face move, but even thoſe of the flanks and breſts, as in its place hereafter.</p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:47499:126"/>
                     <p>This ſurpriſe muſt alſo be pleaſing, and thoſe ridiculous objects muſt produce ſome kinde of Joy in the ſoul. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſenſible in facetious things, and in the encounter of friends: and we never ſeek the occaſions of laughing, but for the pleaſure we think to finde therein. And although we may doubt of that Laughter which indignation, ſcorn, and anger ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times move; yet we will ſhew, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs there is ſtill ſomewhat which affords contentment, either true or feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for it is certain, there is a lying and diſſembled Laughter, wherein effectually there is no ſenſible pleaſure, and in which we onely feign we receive ſome; which is very common in flattery and complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Often, even although the object be pleaſing, the ſoul will finde in it more pleaſure then it is capable to yeeld, and ſo moves, and, as they ſay, tickles it ſelf into a Laughter.</p>
                     <p>But what I eſteem moſt conſiderable to underſtand the nature of Laughter, it is, that we ſeldom uſe it alone, and that the moſt part of thoſe objects which power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excite it in company, move it not at all in a ſolitude; ſo that it ſeems company affords ſomewhat to its production, that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47499:126"/>the ſoul will make it appear that ſhe is ſurpriſed; which would be needleſs, were there no witneſs of what ſhe would do: ſo that ſhe ought not to move Laughter when we are alone. And if in company there happen a pleaſant ſurpriſe which moves it not, it is becauſe ſhe will not make it appear; as when there is ſomwhat that diſpleaſeth her, or when prudence or diſſimulation hinder it. Yet muſt we not believe that ſhe makes uſe of laughter as a mark taken at pleaſure, ſuch as thoſe are which proceed from our choice and invention; but as a natural mark, which hath a neceſſary connexion with the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe repreſents.</p>
                     <p>To know what this connexion is, and the particular reaſon which obligeth the Soul to uſe this motion rather then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to mark the ſurpriſe ſhe is in; you muſt ſuppoſe that in all ſurpriſes the Soul retires, and reenters her ſelf, the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an unthought-of thing oppoſing it ſelf to the liberty of her thoughts, and forcing her to recollect her ſelf the better to diſcern the preſented Object: and then if ſhe intend to make her condition known, ſhe muſt, according to the Law which proportions the organs and the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47499:127"/>effects to their cauſes, ſtir up in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts ſome motion like unto that which ſhe ſuffers, and conſequently cauſe the muſcles to retire towards their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine as ſhe retires and recollects her ſelf in her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe the Minde may be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by troubleſome objects as well as by pleaſing ones, this retraction of the muſcles may be as well with grief as with joy: and indeed, you ſee that in Tears the lips and ſome other parts of the face retire in the ſame manner as in Laughter. Whence it is, that there are perſons in whom it would be difficult to diſcern at firſt ſight the one from the other, ſo like they are to one another: which hath made ſome think that Nature, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins our life with crying and tears, made an eſſay, and deſigned theſe touches which were to be perfected in Laughter, which is never formed before fourty days after birth. Yet as we can never ſay that the retraction of the lips, which accompanies grief, is a true Laughter; ſo we muſt thence conclude that Laughter conſiſts not in the ſimple motion of the muſcles, but that there is alſo a certain air which Joy ſheds over the face, and which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47499:127"/>cauſeth the principal difference.</p>
                     <p>However it be, Laughter being princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſtin'd for converſation, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which particularly reſpect it, are thoſe alſo which the moſt eaſily cauſe Laughter: Such are the actions and face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious words which comprehend all what is uncomely and deformed, light hurts purpoſely done or received out of folly, cheats of ſmall conſequence, jeers; in a word, all deformities without grief: for all theſe things move Laugher, foraſmuch as they mark the defects of thoſe qualities which are neceſſary for converſation; as, of a good grace, of decency, of adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of kindneſs, and of the reſt: the Minde finding it ſelf ſurpriſed, when it ſees contrary actions to thoſe vertues which are the foundations of ſociety and of a civil life.</p>
                     <p>All the difficulty which there is herein, is, to know why the Soul would have the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe it ſuffers in theſe encounters appear; for it ſeems as if it were a defect, which ſhe would do better to hide then to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. In effect, it is a badge of Ignorance, to ſuffer our ſelves to be ſurpriſed with a Novelty, as it is a mark of Malice to be pleaſed at the defects of others: Whence
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47499:128"/>it is that Wiſe men laugh ſeldomer then others, becauſe that they are neither Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant nor Malicious; that few things are new to them, and that they eaſily excuſe imperfections. Yt if you conſider that Man is naturally a lover of himſelf, that he always pretends excellency and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority; we will not think it ſtrange, if, ſeeing the defects of others, he ſeeks to teſtifie that he is exempt from them, and ſo would make you believe, by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and aſtoniſhment they give him, that he is more perfect then they are. Now if a man laugh at his own defects, it is the ſame as when he is angry with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: for, the trouble which theſe Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons involve the Minde in, hinders it from diſcerning the objects which move it, and make it eſteem that ſtrange, which is its own. However it be, this reaſon is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for all ridiculous deformities, and for all things which we ſcorn: It may even ſometimes be applied to that laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Anger and Indignation move, foraſmuch as either of them ſuppoſing ſome injuſtice, either in the offence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or in the good or ill which we ſee happen to thoſe who are unworthy of it; the Soul, which teſtifies the aſtoniſhment
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47499:128"/>it cauſeth, would alſo ſilently perſwade, that ſhe is not capable of thoſe ill actions, and that ſhe is too juſt to do good or ill to thoſe who deſerve it not. And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in this thought ſhe findes her ſelf tickled with ſome ſecret joy which accompanies this pretended excellency; but it is ſmall, by reaſon of the diſpleaſure which goes along with theſe Paſſions; the thought of the preſent ill ſtifling it even almoſt at the ſame time that it is formed: whence it alſo happens, that this Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is light, and of a ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>Now if in theſe encounters we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly touched with any pleaſure, we need not doubt but that all the objects which cauſe Laughter are not pleaſing, as we ſaid at the beginning of this Diſcourſe. All the difference which there is therein, is, that the Pleaſure which follows them hath divers principles: To ſome, it comes from ſelf love, and from that proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency which the ſoul is glad to make appear: to others, it comes from the love of benevolence, and reſpects ſociety, which requires the communication of goods and pleaſures: For when we laugh at the ſight of a friend with careſſes and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47499:129"/>complacencies, we endeavour by that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural language to perſwade that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the actions, and the words are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to us, and that we eſteem them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of the excellency they have, or for the pleaſure or profit they afford us.</p>
                     <p>You will perhaps ſay, that all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are not in Tickling, ſince that in ſtead of moving Joy, it cauſeth Sorrow; That there are few perſons which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it not; and therefore that it is not likely that Laughter which comes from it, ſhould be accompanied with pleaſure; and that the ſoul ſhould uſe it for a mark of that pleaſant ſurpriſe which ſhe is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of. But if theſe Reaſons were good, we muſt baniſh Pleaſure from all the Paſſions; the object of Love would no longer be pleaſing, becauſe that is pungent and unquiet, and that there are but few who fear not to be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. We muſt even ſay as much of Joy, ſince it cauſeth faintings, and that we fear the exceſſes thereof, and that ſometimes it cauſeth death. I muſt confeſs that Grief mixeth it ſelf with theſe Paſſions but as a ſtranger, having no ſhare in their birth or preſervation; they owe both the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47499:129"/>the one and the other to Pleaſure; and when that is no more, then they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily dy. Whatſoever we will believe, we cannot doubt but there is Pleaſure in Tickling, ſince it is never made but by a delicate touch which flatters the Senſes: For we cannot ſay that that kinde of Touching can hurt them; ſince it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes ſleep, and that by harder preſſing the parts we harm them not. On the contrary, you muſt allow it for granted, that the ſoul is pleaſed with that kinde of touch, and that it is ranked amongſt the careſſes; ſince we never expect diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from thoſe who tickle us, but eſteem them always as our friends: So that Laughter which accompanies that moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a witneſs that the ſoul will return the pleaſure it receives, and that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which moves it is grateful to her. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alſo that that excellency whereof we have ſpoken contributes ſomewhat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; foraſmuch as the ſenſe of Feeling being the mark of the good or ill quality of the Minde, and that accordingly as that is more perfect, men are alſo more ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Phyſiognomy and experience teach us, Man by a natural inſtinct is pleaſed with Tickling, and forms a Laughter
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47499:130"/>to ſignifie the perfection of his Senſes and of his Minde.</p>
                     <p>This then is the nature of this Paſſion, whence in my opinion it is eaſie to draw the motive of ridiculous objects: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeems we have the ſame Senſe with thoſe who have placed the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous amongſt new and pleaſing things; and that the ſame abſurdities which we have obſerved in that opinion, are to be met in ours: yet if you obſerve what we have ſaid, you will ſee a very great difference; becauſe that we add to novelty a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which they have omitted; to wit, that the ſoul will witneſs the ſurpriſe which that novelty gives her: ſo that there are new and pleaſant things which do not make us laugh; foraſmuch as the ſoul intends not to diſcover the ſence it hath thereof; ſo when we are alone, and fancy ſome merry matter, we uſually do not laugh at it, but onely when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, becauſe then the minde deſignes to witneſs the ſurpriſe it cauſed.</p>
                     <p>I know well it will hereupon be ſaid, that we often laugh alone, and that there are objects which are ſo powerful that they draw Laughter from the wiſeſt and moſt ſolitary men; and that it is common
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47499:130"/>for Fools to laugh in the ſame manner. But this Truth deſtroys not that which we have eſtabliſhed; foraſmuch as all this happens from the errour of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which diverts it ſelf from the end Nature had preſcribed it. And there are few effects in the Paſſions, wherein the ſame diſorder may not be: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Voice, which was given to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſhew forth the motions of their Soul, doth often go away through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of Grief: Even there are perſons who ſpeak and complain when they are alone; and yet it is againſt the inſtitution of Nature, who deſtined the voice and ſpeech for inſtruments of ſociety, and to ſerve for that communication which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ought to have together. Now all this proceeds from the diſturbance the ſoul feels, and which makes it wander from the way it ſhould keep.</p>
                     <p>And without doubt, the laughter which is obſerved in doatings, comes from the ſame ſource; the Imagination forcing ridiculous objects, which afterwards move the Appetite to produce Laughter. For although it be difficult to comprehend how ſhe can figure any pleaſant thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the griefs thoſe evils produce;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47499:131"/>and that Reaſon, which is ſometimes at liberty in theſe encounters, ſees nothing which contents it; that ſhe even confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this Laughter to be forced, and yet that ſhe cannot hide it: it is nevertheleſs very true, that there is ſtill a ſecret plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, either in the ſuperiour part of the ſoul, or in the ſenſitive. For the alienation of the Minde takes away from frantick perſons the ſenſe of ill; and giveth liking to the Ridiculous Chimera's which are there formed, to move Laughter: So that if Reaſon be not hurt, the Pleaſure muſt be hid in the Senſes, and unwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Underſtanding it cauſeth that commotion there. The Imagination diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not always exactly the Pleaſure which the objects form in the particular Senſes, either becauſe it is diſtracted or ſurpriſed, or becauſe the impreſſion they make is ſecret; although ſtill the ſpirits, the humours, and the bodies agitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves powerfully. So the firſt motions of Paſſions happen in the Minde unawares: and there are divers things which move us, which we can hardly ſay whether they are troubleſome or graceful: we muſt not then wonder if we ſometimes laugh without knowing the cauſe thereof; it is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47499:131"/>ſufficient if the Senſes have a confuſed and ſecret knowledge to ſtir up after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that motion in the Appetite: for there is ſo ſtrong a connexion between theſe powers, that the one is no ſooner touched by the object, but the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it. In this precipitation, the Soul hath not time to diſcern what it doth; and the parts are ſooner touched, then ſhe is adviſed of it; and ſhe is not then able to ſtop the ſhake which ſhe hath given her ſelf; the ſpirits and the humours having received the impreſſion thereof, whoſe impetuoſity cannot be ſo ſuddenly ſtayed. And hence the difficulty comes to hinder Laughter when it is vehement, although it be a voluntary action; in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it happens in other Paſſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Soul ſuffers the ſame violence as he who runs into a precipice: for although he gave himſelf that motion, it is no more in his power to ſtop it; he muſt abandon himſelf to the ſwinge he hath taken, and to that ſteepneſs whence he hath precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated himſelf.</p>
                     <p>What remains of moſt importance, is to know why, of all creatures, Man onely laughs, ſince it appears that other beaſts alſo may be ſurpriſed with Novelty: and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47499:132"/>it is not impoſſible but that they may have a deſigne to ſhew how ſenſible they are thereof, ſince they make other things known by their voice and by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But as there are but two motives which oblige Man to witneſs the ſurpriſe which ridiculous objects cauſe; to wit, his own excellency, and civil ſociety; it is certain that the firſt is uſeleſs to beaſts, who are never touched with glory or with vanity. And for Society, it is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect amongſt them, that it reſpects but the neceſſities of the body, to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they work in common, but yet it is but for their particular intereſt; ſo that there is no communication of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which every one reſents; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the novelty of agreeable things ſurpriſeth them not, to ſpeak properly, no more then they do men who are quite ſtupid; becauſe they do not diſcern whether things are new or no, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them but as if they had always been preſent, although, for to know them new, we muſt imagine they were not always ſo.</p>
                     <p>And it is for that reaſon, that children laugh not before the fourtieth day: for the Soul, which is as it were wholly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47499:132"/>and as it were drown'd in the great quantity of the humors they have, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of no knowledge, but acording as humidity diminiſheth theſe lights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and ſo by degrees ſhe gets the power of laughing, beginning by a ſmile, and after being capable of vehement Laughter. Perhaps ſome will ſay, that the excellency wherewith man flatters himſelf, and the love of ſociety, can no more reach a childe at forty days old then other creatures, being not of a condition to minde either of them; &amp; therefore that they then are not more capable of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then beaſts are, if there be no other motions but thoſe for laugher.</p>
                     <p>But it is not neceſſary exactly to know thoſe things for which we have a natural inclination; for deſires being born with us, carry us alſo by the pure inſtinct of nature to the enquiry of thoſe goods; and from the time that our ſoul hath the liberty to act, ſhe produceth actions which ſhew the ſecret fence ſhe hath of her own excellency, and of her being deſtined to a civil life. Now as beaſts are capable of neither of them, they have alſo no ſhare in this inſtinct, whoſe ſourſe is hidden in the intellectual parts of the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47499:133"/>Soul, and can come from no inferior power: for although there are ſome kinds of Laughter, which ſeem wholly to depend from the ſenſitive, as that which comes from tickling: it is certain that without the influence of the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Faculty, the Senſes cannot produce that effect; its light inſenſibly diſperſeth it ſelf on all its actions, and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they have therewith alwayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ſomewhat of its perfection, which ſtill ſerves to ſhew that beaſts are not capable of laughter, becauſe their Senſes are deprived of that brightneſs, and of that influence which Reaſon cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to flow in ours.</p>
                     <p>Before I finiſh this diſcourſe, I muſt tell you by the way, who thoſe are who are moſt given to laughter; it is certain, that young folkes laugh more willingly then old ones, women then men, fools then wiſe men, ſanguine then cholerick, flegmatick then melancholy; And this comes from that laughter being made by a pleaſing ſurpriſe, which we would make known, thoſe are more eaſily ſurpriſed, &amp; are naturally merrier then theſe: For the ſpirits which move quick, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not things are moſt eaſie to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47499:133"/>and thoſe who are the moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are the moſt eaſily touched with pleaſant objects, and are more fit for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation then others who are ſevere and ſerious: Yet as there are divers ſorts of ridiculous objects, that ſome reſpect our proper excellency, and others ſociety; that there are ſome which require a great knowledge, as quaint jeers, and others wherein a mean one is onely requiſite: So there are alſo ſome perſons which are more eaſily touched then others; the young and cholerick laugh rather at the defects of others, then the old and the wiſe, being naturally inſolent and proud; fools &amp; ignorants obſerve not jeſts, or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty encounters, women and thoſe of a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, complexion are more fit for the laughter which careſſes occaſion, becauſe they have a natural inclination to flattery.</p>
                     <p>After having thus diſcovered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of laughter, and of ridiculous things, we ſhall eaſily give a reaſon for all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which this Paſſion produceth on the body; for there are none which proceed not from the ſurpriſe, and Joy which the Soul reſents: the ſplendor of the eyes, the redneſs of the face, and tears come
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47499:134"/>chiefly from Joy; all the reſt come from ſurpriſe which contracts the muſcles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their principle; the ſoul uſing that exterior motion to ſhew that which it ſuffers interiourly; becauſe as we have ſaid, ſhe retires into her ſelf when ſhe is ſurpriſed; ſo that this contraction of the muſcles is as the ſpring of all the other effects of laughter: And perhaps there is no other made by the ſouls command, all the reſt being of neceſſity and without deſign: For it is very unlikely that the ſoul ſhould intend to form all thoſe plights and wrinkles which are to be at the corners of the eyes, to hold the eyes half ſhut, and the mouth open to render the voice piercing and interrupted, and ſo of the reſt. But theſe are effects which by a neceſſary purſuit accompany the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the muſcles.</p>
                     <p>The better to underſtand this, you muſt remember from what we have already ſaid, that when the ſurpriſe is light, the muſcles of the lips, forehead, and lids onely move; becauſe the Soul intending to make the emotion it feels appear, uſeth this as the moſt manifeſt and moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motion: But when the Surpriſe is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47499:134"/>great, it moves all the muſcles of the face and breſt; and in fine, if it be very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there are none in the whole body which are not moved.</p>
                     <p>Now as there are but few muſcles which have not their contraries, and that there are ſome which lift up a part, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it on one ſide; there are alſo thoſe which bring it down, and draw it on the other ſide: And yet in this contrariety of motion there are ſome ſtronger then others; the actions they are to perform requiring more or leſs ſtrength: From thence it comes, that in Laughter you ſee the parts take that figure which this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of motions gives them. So the <hi>Mouth</hi> keeps half open, becauſe the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which ſerve to open and ſhut it, each moving his way, it muſt neceſſarily retain that figure; and even it muſt appear more ſhut then open, becauſe the muſcles which ſerve to ſhut are the ſtrongeſt. So the <hi>Forehead</hi> remains ſmoothe and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being equally drawn upwards and downwards. The <hi>Eyes</hi> alſo are half ſhut, becauſe the muſcles which incline the lids, are ſtronger then thoſe which lift them up; and ſo conſequently the wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles are formed about the temples, the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47499:135"/>ſkin, which is delicate and fleſhleſs, being drawn by the motion of thoſe muſcles, and conſtrained to grow uneven. The <hi>Noſe</hi> ſhrinks up, and grows ſharp, becauſe the muſcles which lift it up, having no contraries, have always the liberty to lift it up, which cannot be done, but that the ſkin which covers them muſt wrinkle, and the extremity of the Noſe appear ſharp. The <hi>Lips</hi> lengthen out themſelves, becauſe the muſcles which draw them on the ſide, are ſtronger then thoſe which contract them; and even the upper lip ſtretcheth it ſelf more then the under, becauſe its muſcles are more powerful. The <hi>Tongue</hi> ſhortens it ſelf a little, and ſuſpends it ſelf, being equally drawn on either ſide. The <hi>Neck</hi> contracts and thickens it ſelf, becauſe the muſcles ſhorten when they retire themſelves. The <hi>Cheeks</hi> for the ſame reaſon lift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up, and grow firmer; and, in ſome, a little dent is formed in the middle of them, the ſkin being tied in thoſe parts by ſome ſmall veins which reſtrain it whilſt the ſurrounding parts lift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up.</p>
                     <p>Before we ſeek the cauſes of the breſts and flanks motions, and of that interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47499:135"/>voice which appears here; we muſt obſerve that the muſcles do not retire themſelves in a vehement laughter by an uniform and continued contraction, but by ſeveral girds and ſhakes; whether it be that in the deſigne the Minde hath to witneſs its ſurpriſe, it moves it ſelf, and redoubles its ſtruglings; or that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the object ſollicites it, and by fits repreſents it ſelf unto it, as it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to be in other Paſſions, wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment the ſoul animates and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it ſelf by thoſe new Idea's which the object forms in the Fancie.</p>
                     <p>This then is the reaſon why thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled motions appear in Laughter, and chiefly in the flanks, by reaſon of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma which is there ſituated, and which is extremely moveable. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the agitation is violent, it cauſeth alſo a pain in this part, whither the hands caſt themſelves, as if they ought to eaſe it. For although they unwittingly do it, Nature who takes care for the preſervation of its parts, directs the hands to thoſe places where the ill may offend them, without being led thither by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Diſcourſe. So when a man falls, or is ready to receive a blowe, the hands by
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47499:136"/>a natural inſtinct caſt themſelves preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the face.</p>
                     <p>As for the reſt, as the Diaphragma is the chief organ of reſpiration, that muſt neceſſarily be made with the ſame ſhakes which that part ſuffers: and afterwards the voice muſt be interrupted, becauſe the air iſſues not equally, and the muſcles which ſhould form it, ſtart up as the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma doth. For we ſaid, that all the muſcles retired themſelves by ſurpriſes in a vehement laughter: Whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the head, the ſhoulders, and the arms ſhake themſelves in the ſame faſhion as the flanks do. In fine, this general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction which is made in all the organs of voluntary motion, is the cauſe that all the body folds up and contracts it ſelf, that it is impoſſible to ſwallow any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the muſcles which ſerve for that action, contract and ſhut up their paſſages; and that Laughter ſometimes cauſeth the ſame effects as Medicines do, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of thoſe parts which contain the humours. Now foraſmuch as theſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent girds of the Diaphragma hinder the liberty of reſpiration, and are the cauſe it cannot contract and enlarge it ſelf as it ought; thence it comes, that at laſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47499:136"/>breath and ſpeech is loſt, that the pulſe grows irregular, weakneſs follows, and ſometimes death: For reſpiration is ſo neceſſary for life, that when it is hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the forces are loſt, and the whole oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Nature changed. For which cauſe, in this neceſſity the ſoul ſtruggles very much to oppoſe this diſorder: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe makes haſte to draw a great quantity of air, as if ſhe ſtole that refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the violence of her paſſion: ſometimes ſhe makes a long breathing, to drive away thoſe fumes which the heat of the heart at every moment produceth, and ſo forms thoſe precipitated ſobs and ſighs which mingle themſelves with Laughter.</p>
                     <p>I do not ſtay particularly to examine why the Pulſe beats irregularly, nor why weakneſs and ſyncopes happen in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: It is well known that the Pulſe and Reſpiration follow one the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both deſtined to one end; and that weakneſs and faintings come from the diſorder which is made in the heart, which cannot ſuffer a greater, then the hinderance of reſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Before we end this enquiry, it will not be amiſs to rehearſe the opinions which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47499:137"/>have been hitherto held touching the motion of the muſcles in Laughter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the abſurdities in them, will the more confirm the cauſes we have dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. All who have ſpoken thereof, have agreed in this point, that this motion is made out of neceſſity, and that the Soul is not miſtreſs thereof: But ſome have believed the Spirits were the cauſe; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it was the agitation of the heart. The firſt ſay that Joy driving the Spirits to the outward parts, it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal fills the muſcles, which are thereby conſtrained to ſhrink up and contract themſelves, as it happens in convulſionfits. But if this were true, all the Paſſions which carry the Spirits outwardly, muſt move Laughter: Shame, Anger, and Deſire would never appear without it; and a Fever and pain would cauſe a man to laugh continually, ſeeing they fill the face with blood and ſpirits. Others who believe the agitation of the heart is the ſource of all theſe motions, ſay that Joy cauſing it to move, the Diaphragma which is tied to it, muſt neceſſarily do ſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its motion, and that after it moves the muſcles of the breſt and lips, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it hath communication and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47499:137"/>as it is eaſie to judge by the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the lips, which always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the hurts of the Diaphragma. To confirm this, they aſſure us, that beaſts laugh not, becauſe their Diaphragma is tyed to the heart with looſer and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ligatures then it is to mans, whence it is that the heart cannot ſhake it whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commotion Joy make.</p>
                     <p>But this opinion is no leſs abſurd then the former; for then in all the Paſſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the heart is extraordinarily agitated, the Diaphragma muſt be ſhaken in the ſame manner, and muſt move Laughter; and even Laughter could never be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the agitation of the Diaphragma, if it were true that its contraction cauſeth that of the lips, which are all contrary to experience: And therefore the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they bring of the ligaments of the Diaphragma is inconſiderable, and ſerves not at all to prove what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: For if that of men is more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyed to the membrane that covers the heart, then to that of beaſts; that comes from that it being inclined downwards, and altogether hanging in the humane body, by reaſon of its upright figure, it is neceſſary it ſhould be more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47499:138"/>born up then that of beaſts which hath not that ſituation.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſympathy it hath with the lips, I finde it ſomewhat doubtful, becauſe beſides that it communicates not to them all the diſpoſitions it hath, we have often obſerved great hurts in that part, which have not excited Laughter; and if that have ſometimes happened, I beleeve not that it was an effect of the convulſion; ſince <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, that who ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a wound in that part, laughs from the firſt of his hurt, and feels no convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion till the third day after; ſo that it is likely it was not the convulſion, but rather the raving whereinto he fell, which cauſed that Laughter after the manner beforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>It is then a moſt certain thing, that the motion of the muſcles which forms Laughter, is a voluntary action made by the ſouls command, and not by neceſſity, as tears, ſweat, the luſtre and the redneſs of the face are, ſo that they may be hindered and reſtrained at firſt, when the humours and the ſpirits are not yet much ſhaken; and thence it comes that oftentimes hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your mouth ſhut, your breath and voice being conſtrained to paſs through
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47499:138"/>the noſtrils, cauſe an interrupted bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which is obſerved in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>As for the luſter of the eyes, the colour and blthneſs which appears in the face; for the voice which becomes groſſer for ſweat and tears, we have already ſaid they come from Joy, which every way diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſpirits, diſſolves the humours, and opens the paſſages. But I would add for what concernes Tears; that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the muſcles, which cauſes the eyes and the lids to move, is the principal cauſe thereof. For when they come to cloſe themſelves, they preſs and ſqueeze the humors and the ſpirits, and conſtrain them to iſſue; and indeed all thoſe parts are ſoft and moiſt, and the under-lid is ſituated ſo, that it eaſily receives the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which run from the neighbouring parts: It ſeems even that Nature deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to that end; were it to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the freſhneſs, and natural humidity of the eye, or to diſcharge it from that which might incommodate it? And there is a great appearance that the little holes which appear on the ſide of that lid, when it begins to quit the corner of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47499:139"/>the eye, was onely made to void thoſe humors, when they are in too great a quantity; which being ſo, we need not doubt but when that part contracts it ſelf, the humour which is contained therein, muſt be forced to iſſue at that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paſſage, and muſt render the eyes moiſt: And what confirms me in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, is, that tears run not in Laughter, as in Joy, and in Grief: it ſeems that they are forced, and that they iſſue but by compulſion; and it is eaſie to judge that their ſource comes not from ſo high a place as the others, and that you need go no farther then the neighbourhood to ſeek it; neither are they ever ſo abundant as in thoſe Paſſions, the eyes from whence they come being not capable to contain ſo much humor as the brain; and even thoſe whom ſorrow hath never cauſed to weep, by reaſon of their natural drineſs, finde tears when they laugh, becauſe they come but from the neighbouring parts, no more then thoſe which ſore eyes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſe. Let us then conclude that Joy carries the humors, and the ſpirits to the outward parts, and that the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the muſcles ſtirs them, and ſends
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47499:139"/>them out, whence comes teares in the eyes, and ſweat in the face, and flanks; Becauſe that it is in that place where the Motion is moſt violent, and the skin moſt delicate.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the Soul (according to <hi>Socrates)</hi> hath wings, they can onely be in the Deſires; it is they which move her wherever ſhe will go: they raiſe her up to heaven, and make her deſcend into the abyſs; and by a ſtrange and wonderful kinde of motion, they cauſe her to go out of her ſelf without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding her, and tranſport her everywhere without ever quitting the place wherein ſhe is. And we may ſay, that Nature was never ſo wiſe or ingenious in any of her works, as in this: For, having made the Soul void and unprovided of all things, and having placed all neceſſary goods without her, ſhe was obliged to furniſh her with a vertue which might carry her towards them, and which might unite
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47499:140"/>them together. She muſt have afforded her, in the priſon wherein ſhe hath enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her, the uſe of that liberty which was born with her; and without breaking her chains, ſhe muſt ſuffer her to go thorow the Univerſe, which ſhe hath ſubmitted to her laws and judgements. In fine, after having been drawn from heaven, and been baniſhed from the place of her birth, ſhe muſt needs give way, at leaſt to her thoughts, to return ſometimes thither. And that during her exile ſhe may have ſome commerce with thoſe Divine things wherewith ſhe is allyed, which at laſt ought to crown the pains and labours of her baniſhment; now ſhe hath given her Deſires, to draw her to thoſe goods ſhe was without; to ſet her at liberty, and to raiſe her up to heaven, which is the place of her nativity, and the ſource of her fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities.</p>
                     <p>We muſt indeed believe that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal objects which ought to move this fair Paſſion in us, are not to be found on earth, nor amongſt vile &amp; tranſitory things: our Soul being immortal, needs not corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things: And if there are things which conduce to her perfection, they muſt be more noble and more excellent then ſhe:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47499:141"/>ſhe muſt ſeek them from above. In a word, God alone ſhould enflame her Deſires, ſince he alone can fill that infinite depth and immenſe vaſtneſs of hers.</p>
                     <p>Neither did this wiſe Philoſopher who fancied ſhe had wings, think they were for any other uſe but to carry her towards that primary and ſoveraign Idea of Good. When he perceived her to deſcend, and run after corruptible things, he then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſhe had loſt them; that ſhe rather got a fall, then made a flight; that ſhe was then in the body, not onely as in a Priſon, but as in a Tomb: For being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of no natural motion therein, nor ſeeing no agitation of that Divine fire wherewith they ſay ſhe is clothed, he had reaſon to believe that ſhe ceaſed to live, or that ſhe tranſmigrated into the nature of thoſe Bruits which onely look on the earth, and which according to his opinion are rather ſhadows then that they have true beings. It is true, that the Senſes which are under her conduct, oblige her to ſeek what is fit for her; that ſhe muſt provide for the neceſſities of the body, which ſerves her in her functions: But Reaſon hath reduced her cares to ſuch narrow bounds, and Nature hath render'd
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47499:141"/>neceſſary things ſo common, that there is ſcarce a way left to wiſh them: at leaſt, if we muſt employ thereabouts a part of our Deſires, it ought to be the weakeſt, and the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>It were indeed to offend the dignity of the Soul, and the excellency of thoſe Goods whereto ſhe ought to aſpire, to deſtine ſo many noble deſires which ſhe can form, to ſuch vile and uſeleſs things; it were even in ſtead of enriching her, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her neceſſitous, ſince it is certain, that Deſire is the meaſure of Poverty, and that as many things as the Soul deſires, ſo many things doth ſhe ſtand in need of: So that, in ſeeking more goods for the body then are needful, ſhe renders it ſo much the more neceſſitous, and oppreſſeth it with the poverty ſhe hath cauſed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the Deſires being as the pawns and earneſts which the Soul gives of her ſubjection to thoſe things ſhe ſeeks, if they are conformable to Nature, and her dignity, this ſubjection is honeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; they are her firſt ſteps towards ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and felicity: But if ſhe engageth her ſelf to ſubjects unworthy of her, ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits her ſelf to her enemies, and opens a door to all vices &amp; miſchances which may befal her.</p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:47499:142"/>
                     <p>We ought to engage our ſelves no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in theſe Conſiderations which belong to Moral Philoſophy; we will therefore purſue our Deſigne, and preſent you with the Characters of this Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>It is a bold undertaking, to deſigne the picture of Deſire. It is ſo ſubtil and ſo changeable a Paſſion, that it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to finde colours wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it: It is a <hi>Proteus</hi> which aſſumes as many figures as there are imaginary goods: It inceſſantly flies like the winde, it everywhere mixeth it ſelf like the air: And Picture cannot have a greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to form bodies for theſe things, then the Minde to deſigne the Characters of this Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>It is true, there are Deſires which may eaſily be expreſt; that without difficulty we may deſcribe Ambition, Avarice, and Luxury; that Hunger, and other Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of Senſe, may eaſily be expreſt. But to touch theſe differences, is not to form a general Idea of Deſire, as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged our ſelves to do. To follow then the Order we have propoſed, we muſt take off this Paſſion from all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar objects, and conſider onely the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which are common to all kindes.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47499:142"/>We will then begin by its Moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Although Deſires, as children of Love, make the ſame advance and growth with Love it ſelf, and that at their birth they are but ſmall ſparks which by little and little inreaſe, and afterwards become great flames; yet it often happens that they break out all at once, and that at firſt they have the ſame force and vehemency which time uſeth to give them; you would think them thoſe artificial fires which kindle in an inſtant, and whoſe flame no ſooner appears, but it devours all the matter which ſerves for its food, which carries with it all that ſtops it, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all that oppoſeth its courſe. For at the ſame time that they take in the Minde, they occupie all its thoughts, they take away its reaſon, and hurry it towards the deſired good thorow all obſtacles and hinderances that oppoſe it. At that time, ſhe ſlights all counſels, and all danger. Prohibition kindles her luſts, &amp; difficulty provokes them: Neither doth ſhe believe that her Deſires can be noble, unleſs they are extreme; nor generous, unleſs they be raſh.</p>
                     <p>In purſuit of theſe dangerous Maximes,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47499:143"/>you need not wonder that he who is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with this Paſſion, becomes inſolent and importunate; he ſpeaks but of what he wiſhes, he inceſſantly demands it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth a refuſal give him the check; and when his mouth is ſtopt, his eyes ſtill ſollicite for it, and beg more eagerly then his words did before. You may obſerve a certain impatient ardor, and I know not what urging avidity which ſeems to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the deſired good. And when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, you would ſay they throw themſelves on it, that they raviſh it, and devour it even with their looks.</p>
                     <p>But if in this encounter his eyes are clear ſighted, his judgement is blinded; he neither conſiders his own nor other mens condition. In his purſuits, there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways is either an inſolent liberty, or an infamous ſubmiſſion: and all the excuſe he hath for his impudence or baſeneſs, is, that he believes he deſerves what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and that abſolutely he muſt have it. To obtain it, what cares and what pains he takes! He goes, he comes, he ſeeks; he adviſeth with one, he aſks help of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he threatens, he begs: in fine, he is never at reſt, &amp; ſuffers no body to be ſo; for even when he is alone, he turns over in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47499:143"/>his mind all thoſe powers which may ſerve or traverſ him. He hath no thoughts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome of his friends or of his enemies are not intereſſed: and whoever could ſee the deſignes he meditates in his heart, would ſay that it was there where all the ſtorms were formed, which were to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all the world. But indeed, all theſe tempeſts commonly are nothing elſe but a noiſe; they vaniſh in uſeleſs and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent deſignes; and all the ill they cauſe, is that they drive away the tranquillity of the Minde they move in. And truely, whoever deſires, is expoſed to four Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, as impetuous windes, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly agitate him: Audacity and Fear, Hope and Deſpair, do alternatively ſhake him, and often ſo haſtily ſucceed one the other, that they mix and confound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together. He fears, he hopes, he deſpairs at the ſame time; he wills, and he will not; and often, through the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of deſiring, he knows not what he deſires.</p>
                     <p>His irreſolution and his diſquiet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears even outwardly: for he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in one place, or in one poſture; he turns from the one ſide to the other; he ſits, he riſeth, he goes with long ſtrides,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47499:144"/>and ſtops of a ſudden. Sometimes he ſo profoundly doats, that you would think him raviſhed in an Extaſie; and at that inſtant he awakes, ſending forth, with great ſighs, now a ſharp, and now a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing voice. His words are interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſobs and tears, and his diſcourſe is full of long exclamations and paſſionate accents, which commonly accompany im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, regret, and languor. He moſt commonly ſpeaks to himſelf, interrogates and anſwers himſelf: And if others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him, his minde is always diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his anſwers confuſed and entangled, and ſometimes even his ſpeech is cut quite off, what endeavour ſoever he makes to utter it. His mouth is filled with a clear and ſubtil water; his tongue trembles by intervals; and licking his lips, he moiſtens and whitens them with froth. His face is ſwelled, and grows red; his head advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it ſelf on the deſired object; his arms extend themſelves towards it. Even his heart, as ſtraitned and contracted as it is, darts it ſelf out in great throbs, and raiſeth the breſt with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that the ribs ſometimes are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted. Appetite and Sleep foſake him. Sometimes he grows Gray in a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47499:144"/>moment; all his radical moiſture is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; his body grows lean and dry; and nothing but Enjoyment or Death can terminate his languor and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>

                        <head>PART. 2. <hi>Of the Nature of Deſire.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>AT firſt, it ſeems as if there were no difficulty to ſay what deſire is; as it never forms it ſelf, but for thoſe things which we have not, and which we would have, we may eaſily beleeve that the object which excites it, is an abſent good that the Soul endeavours to draw neer unto it, and that the motion it makes towards it, cauſeth alſo all the eſſence of this Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>But who ever examines it carefully, will finde more doubts then reſolutions, and in purſuit will confeſs that there are many things to be deſired in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon knowledge of the deſires; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that we deſire the good we poſſeſs, and that ill oftentimes is wiſhed; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that this definition confounds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47499:145"/>and Love, and makes no eſſential difference which may diſtinguiſh them one from another; for if the good by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent moves the deſire, we muſt ceaſe to love that good when it is abſent from us, or Love and Deſire muſt be but one Paſſion, although it be an unheard of thing amongſt the Philoſophers, that two ſpecies ſhould be confounded in one, and that we ſhould ceaſe to love good when it is no longer preſent. Beſides that abſence ſeems not to be the true Object of Deſire, nor to be any part of it, as ſome have thought, ſince there is nothing in it which is able to draw the appetite to it, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an il then a good; &amp; therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire having no other object but goodneſs, and ſeeing the motion it makes towards it ought to be like that of Love, it muſt needs be (againſt the maximes of the moſt wholeſome Philoſophy) that they are not two different Paſſions; and that Love, Deſire, and Joy it ſelf, are but the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>Now this concluſion took its original from that theſe Paſſions were defined in too general termes, and that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the motion was not ſpecified, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was proper to every of them: for ſince
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47499:146"/>all their eſſence conſiſts in motion, if they are different amongſt themſelves, it muſt be by the diverſity of their motions, and their definitions muſt expreſs the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar agitation which is found in every of them.</p>
                        <p>To finde that then of Deſire, we muſt ſuppoſe that this Paſſion alwayes follows Love: becauſe we onely Deſire the things we beleeve good; and when ill excites our deſires, it is always under the ſhow and appearance of good: For the death which an unhappy man ſeeks, ſeems to him the haven and end of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: danger to men of courage is the fountain of glory and honour. In fine, all the world deſires the eſtrangement of ill, for that it is a good to be delivered from it.</p>
                        <p>Deſire therefore hath good for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and conſequently it alwayes follows Love; ſince Love is the firſt motion the Soul makes after good; in effect aſſoon as the appetite hath received the image, and Idea of good, it moves towards it, and at that inſtant unites it ſelf to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is preſented to it; and this union cauſeth the Paſſion of Love, as we have ſaid before: but becauſe this union gives
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47499:146"/>us not always the perfect poſſeſſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that the good preſents it ſelf not alwayes wholly, or whether the things beſides that Ideal being which they have in their thoughts, have another true and real one, which alſo requires a real uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when the Soul hath acknowledged that it hath not wholly enjoyed the good which was preſented to it, it is unſatisfied with the firſt motion it made towards it, not to have been united to its Idea, it ſeeks it out of it ſelf, and forms this Paſſion which we call Deſire.</p>
                        <p>This being granted, it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what the motion of the appetite is, when it is agitated in this encounter: for in Love it moves ſtraight forwards to the Idea of good; but in Deſire it ſeems to quit it, and as if it would run out of it ſelf, it darts it ſelf towards the abſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: So that it is very likely theſe two motions are made one after the other, principally if they are violent; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them wholly moving the Soul, and driving it ſeveral wayes, it ſeems as if they could not meet together, and that of neceſſity the appetite muſt firſt unite it ſelf to the imagined good; ſince it purſues it, when it is abſent, and that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47499:147"/>afterwards it takes its firſt courſe going from one to the other, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from time to time; in effect we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the deſires appear not in the Soul, but as lightnings; that they are onely throws and flaſhes which it gives it ſelf, and that their continuance depends onely from the doubles and frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes they make.</p>
                        <p>So that they may be exactly defined, in ſaying, <hi>That they are Motions of the Appetite, by which the Soul darts it ſelf towards the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good, purpoſely to draw near and unite it ſelf thereunto.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet muſt you not imagine, that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite in darting it ſelf ſo, goes beyond its natural bounds, and that as animate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies it goes from one to another, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards the abſent good: all this agitation is made in it ſelf, as we ſaid in the diſcourſe of Love; and although it ſeems as if it would caſt it ſelf out, it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beats againſt its bounds, and drives thoſe parts as waves, which beat on the ſhore without being able to go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>But ſince in effect the Soul goes not out of it ſelf, and that conſequently it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth not the deſtined good, we may
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47499:147"/>enquire to what purpoſe the motion ſerves which it makes in this encounter: we muſt doubtleſs confeſs that it is often uſeleſs to it, if it penetrates not into the Faculties, which may move the creature towards the good, and give it the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof: For Nature hath given the Appetite the power to move it ſelf thus, onely to inſpire the ſame Motion into thoſe Faculties which are under its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The agitation it gives it ſelf, is the Idea of that which the moving quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ought to have outwardly; it is like the chalk, and the deſigne of a work which is to be finiſhed in the Organs; but if it reſt there, they prove vain and uſeleſs throws and ſallies; they are imperfect Motions and unformed deſires, which in ſome manner offend Nature; for that ſhe having deſtined them for action, they deſtroy the order and commerce which ſhe hath eſtabliſhed amongſt the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul, when they drive them not to the end ſhe propoſeth.</p>
                        <p>In effect, there is ſo great a relation, and ſo eſſential an order between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and the enjoyment; that we never form deſires for thoſe things which we beleeve impoſſible; becauſe the Soul at
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47499:148"/>that time hath no end nor aim to work, and can produce no action, unleſs it have a motive to excite it, and which ſtaggers it, ſince that the end is the firſt of all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that which gives them efficacy and Motion.</p>
                        <p>I know that there are ſeveral things we unprofitably ſeek which can never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, what care or pains ſoever we take: but for that we do not conſider the impediments and obſtacles, which we ought therein to encounter: And if rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſometimes propoſeth them, and that contrary to its advice we continue to wiſh for them; this diſorder comes from the imagination, which moſt commonly fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies things feaſible, which eaſily perſwade the Appetite thereunto, which afterwards cauſeth thoſe vain and chimerical deſires, of which we have now ſpoken.</p>
                        <p>It is far a greater difficulty to know how this darting forth may be effected, when Deſire mixeth it ſelf with Fear, Grief, and other Paſſions where the Soul inwardly retires it ſelf, and venters it ſelf ſooner then it ſeems to have gone out.</p>
                        <p>We may well beleeve that theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions follow one another, as we ſaid it happens in Love, that after the preſence
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47499:148"/>of ill hath made the Appetite retreat, Deſire ſends it forth again to ſeek the good, which is to accrew unto it by the abſence of the ill; and that there is thus every moment a continual ebbing and flowing of all theſe Paſſions; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this happens not always ſo, and that even in flying, the Soul may make the Motion which the Deſire asketh, without being obliged to return the ſame way. As he who flees his enemy, at the ſame time gets farther from him, and neerer the place of his ſecurity; ſo it is likely the Appetite retiring it ſelf, may at once ſhun evil and purſue good: and that the ſame endeavours and the ſame ſtrivings it makes to haſten its flight, may alſo ſerve to form thoſe deſires which it hath to poſſeſs the good it fancies; and that it ſeeks to go out of it ſelf in the ſame manner, as when there is nothing but what is purely good which attracts it; for the Soul is ſo much diſturbed at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ill, that it ſeems as if it were not enough to flee and eſtrange herſelf from it; but that ſhe muſt even hide and ſteal her ſelf away from her ſelf, that ſhe may by precipitating her flight go beyond her bounds, and go out of herſelf, as
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47499:149"/>ſhe doth in the purſuit of good. But it is an errour which the Paſſions eaſily inſpire in a blind power, which is not guided by Reaſon; whatſoever endeavour ſhe makes, ſhe remaines ſtill within her own limits, and leaves not thoſe places which ſhe beleeves ſhe hath abandoned: it is true that the Spirits which follow the Motions, in effect retire to the Centre of the Body, and that the Organs cauſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al flight in the creature, which is ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this Paſſion; but all this is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Soul, and we are to ſpeak onely of what is within.</p>
                        <p>For the full clearing of this definition we have given, there remains onely to be examined, whether the <hi>Abſent Good</hi> is the true Object of Deſire; for we propoſed at the beginning of this diſcourſe two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable Objections which ſeem to prove the contrary, ſince it is evident we often deſire the things we enjoy; and that Abſence being an evil, is rather capable to take off the Appetite, then to provoke it thereunto; ſo that in this caſe, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Deſire cannot be different from that of Love, and ſo both muſt be but one Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt we have already ſhewed in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47499:149"/>the former Diſcourſes, that when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the good we poſſeſs, we alwayes fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſomewhat which we doe not yet enjoy, whether it be that the moſt part of goods not preſenting themſelves to it in the whole, there muſt ſtill be a part wanting, or whether this poſſeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be but of a ſhort continuance we deſire its continuation as a good which is ſtill to come.</p>
                        <p>To the ſecond, we muſt ſay, although it be true that abſence draws not the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and that it is goodneſs onely; it doth not therefore follow, that Love and Deſire have the ſame Motives, nor that both make but one Paſſion; for beſides that it ſeems that Motion draws not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways its ſpecies from the end it tends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but ever from the middle through which it paſſeth to reach thither; as we may judge by the circular Motion, which is onely different from the direct, but for that it makes a bent line; and for that cauſe ſhould theſe Paſſions have but one Object, yet they muſt be of different ſpecies, by reaſon of the different way they take to attain it; it is true, that in moral things the conditions and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which have no relation with the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47499:150"/>Object diverſifie the Motives of Actions, and that the abſence of Good gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motion to the Soul then goodneſs of it ſelf alone gives; for although it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeeks to unite it ſelf to the good it knows, if it be not preſent, it muſt add another deſign to this firſt inclination, and take care to draw near what is far from it, before it can unite it ſelf, and gain a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enjoyment; ſo that the true Motion of Deſire is the Souls drawing neer, and not the union nor enjoyment; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Motive of Love, and this of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as we have it elſewhere. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Appetite is agitated by ſeveral Motions in all theſe Paſſions; for in this it Parts it ſelf, and gets out of itſelf; in Love it binds it ſelf to the Idea of Good, and in pleaſure pours it ſelf on it.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>SInce the Motion of the Spirits is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to that of the Appetite, we may without much difficulty, ſay how they are agitated in this Paſſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have ſhowed how the Appetite in ſome ſort diverts it ſelf from the Idea of good, to move towards the abſent Object.</p>
                        <p>For Love which always precedes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, having drawn them from the heart, and carried them to the imagination, to unite them to the image of the good it fancied; Deſire follows, which retires them and caſts them forth, to come neerer the good it thinks far of: And thence it happens, that the face ſwels and grows
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47499:151"/>red, that the eyes advance themſelves, and ſeem as if they would go out of their place; the ſpirits which eſcape drawing with them the moſt noble parts, and driving thoſe which oppoſe their iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
                        <p>But it may be demanded, if the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite effectually goes not out of it ſelf, is it therefore ſo with the Spirits? is it ſufficient they beat againſt their bounds, and ſtop after that vain endeavour? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greateſt part paſs no farther; as they are the firſt Organs of the Soul, without which ſhe can effect no perfect action, ſhe with-holds them to her power, neither do they ſeparate themſelves from her but with great violence; for if as it is likely, they are animated, or if they are of thoſe inſtruments which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be united to their principle, they cannot go far from the Soul without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves; and when that happens, it muſt be againſt their intention, ſince every thing endeavours its own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; when therefore Deſire drives them to the ſurface of the Body, the Soul which is conſtrained to keep within its bounds, keeps in alſo the Spirits; but this hinders not a part of them from
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47499:151"/>eſcaping, and the impetuoſity of their Motion from caſting them beyond their preſcribed limits. They are fluid bodies, they diſperſe and ſteal away with the leaſt agitation, they penetrate everywhere, and no reſiſtance can ſtop them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as they are Organs of the Soul, they love to be always with her; yet as they are ſubtil and looſe bodyes, which have a great affinity with the air, their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is to deliver themſelves from the priſon wherein they are, and to leave the mixture of thoſe groſs and impure things, to unite themſelves to their like.</p>
                        <p>But it is alſo true, that they often iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue by the Souls command; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot leave the body it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, it ſends them to execute its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and cauſeth that tranſport, and that influence of Spirits, of which we have ſpoken in our Diſcourſe of Love out of Inclination.</p>
                        <p>Yet we muſt obſerve that all deſires drive not the Spirits into the outward parts; there are thoſe which move them not, as thoſe which are formed in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream part of the Soul, whoſe actions need no Organs. It is true thoſe deſires
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47499:152"/>cannot long ſtay without the Motion of the Spirits: for the Imagination is ſo neer the Underſtanding, that at laſt it always diſcovers a part of what it doth chuſe; and then working on the Idea's it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Spirits run to its ſervice, and agitate the body in the moſt ſecret actions of the will; ſo that in the moſt Spiritual Paſſions, which ſhould be hid from infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior powers, we ſee they bear a part, and ſenſibly alter the Body.</p>
                        <p>There are even of theſe deſires, which are formed in the ſenſitive Appetite, ſome which crave no aſſiſtance from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes: For when we deſire a good which is no more, or is far diſtant from us, we know that neither the ears, nor the eyes are employed in the inquiry of it. The Soul alone operates, and even then the Spirits it moves arrive not at theſe Organs: They caſt themſelves onely on the ſubſtance of the brain, and diſperſe themſelves on this and on that ſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſing a change in the outward parts.</p>
                        <p>In fine, it is an undoubted thing, that the Deſire which accompanies Fear, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs, and the other Paſſions, which flee what is harmful, carries not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47499:152"/>outwardly, as thoſe which purely ſeek the good, or reſiſt the ill. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it retires them inwardly, at leaſt if it cauſe not this Motion, it reſiſts it not, but follows the impetuoſity wherewith the Spirits are carried away. But it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo certain, that when theſe cowardly Paſſions have brought them back again to the heart, Deſire again darts them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out, as if they were to paſs beyond it; and that preſently after theſe former, recal them, making thus a long combat of contrary Motions which cauſe this great trouble, and violent agitation which is at that time felt in the entrails.</p>
                        <p>Now we ſhould examine whether De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire dilate the Spirits, whether it drives them with equality; laſtly whether it ſtirs onely the pureſt blood, and the ſweeteſt humours which are in the veins, as we have diſcovered was done in Love. But ſince we have obſerved that Deſire mixeth it ſelf with all the Paſſions, that it is often with Grief and with Fear, which contract the Spirits, and often with Love and Joy, which extend them; that it always accompanies Anger, how turbulent or impetuous ſoever it be, and in which the moſt Malignant humours
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47499:153"/>are agitated we muſt acknowledge that all theſe kinds of Motions are indifferent to it, that it fits it ſelf to them all; That ſometimes it dilates the Spirits, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it contracts them; and at other times it drives them with confuſion and vehemency, otherwhiles with order and moderation, according to the Nature of thoſe Paſſions with which it allyes it ſelf: Yet this takes not of the difficulty; for ſince Deſire preſuppoſeth Love, it ſeems as if all the Motions which accompany this Paſſion are to be found in Deſire, and that conſequently the Spirits are therein agitated in the ſame beforeſaid manner. But beſides that we have not ſpoken in thoſe places of Love in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but only of that which Beauty inſpires, it is evident that the greateſt part of the Paſſions are formed, and that after Love hath dilated the Spirits, others may be raiſed which may contract them, to which Deſire may ally it ſelf. Otherwiſe as the emotion of the Soul precedes that of the Spirits, it is often formed of thoſe Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in which the Spirits are not moved; becauſe the Appetite agitates with ſo much ſwiftneſs, and ſo nimbly paſſeth from one Paſſion to another, that they
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47499:153"/>have not time to follow its Motions, and ſo obey onely the laſt and moſt vehement. Thus Love may mixe it ſelf with Deſire, without giving to the Spirits the Motion it would have, were it alone, or that it longer or more forcibly poſſeſt the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſing that Love dilates them, and Deſire joynes it ſelf with it, will it not cauſe any change? certainly when the Soul ſees the good abſent, and that in effect ſhe poſſeſſeth it not, ſhe muſt bate ſomewhat of the deſigne ſhe had to open and extend herſelf, to unite her to its Idea, and ſhe gathers her ſelf toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to purſue it the more ſwiftly: So that it is likely ſhe contracts not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in this Paſſion as ſhe doth in Fear; but that ſhe reunites and ſomewhat rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers them, driving them towards the abſent Good. But we will forbear theſe things which being too ſubtil, and too obſcure, flee from our ſight, and tire the minde; that we may ſeek the cauſes of the Characters we have marked.</p>

                        <p>LOve and Deſire, being the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Paſſions of the minde, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the moſt fruitful in actions; but if you reſpect the cauſes which are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt their effects, you muſt confeſs that Deſire is the moſt active; and that all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actions, although they proceed from Love, as from their original ſource, ſeem to draw their origine from Deſire, as from their neereſt and moſt ſenſible cauſe: ſo that we may ſay that Love is as it were the ſeed, but that Deſire is the ſtock or trunk which affords life and motion to all the branches. However it be, we have not undertaken to give an account of all the effects which this Paſſion produceth: it will be ſufficient to examine the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47499:154"/>and the moſt ordinary. And firſt of all to enquire what it is that renders it importunate, impudent, baſe, and unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, why it is boundleſs, and how difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties provoke it.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that who ardently deſires a thing renders himſelf eaſily <hi>Importunate,</hi> becauſe the violent Paſſion he hath to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, makes him blindly ſeek it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering the perſons, and without examining the time or the place which might favour him in his deſigne; he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues it everywhere, he craves it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and as if all the world ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his pleaſure, he ſolicites, he urgeth, he tires all thoſe whoſe ſuccour he may have, and which may make him enjoy the good he deſires: beſides having no other thought but that, and his minde being continually bent on that Object, reaſon findes no time to be underſtood, nor power to contain the ſallies of this unbridled Paſſion. She even ſuffers her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be thereby carried away, and ſo abandons the conduct of her actions to blinde and raſh powers.</p>
                        <p>And even from thence, that <hi>Impudence</hi> comes which commonly accompanies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; for as it is a certain boldneſs which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47499:155"/>makes us with pleaſure undertake diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt things, and which makes us ſcorn the imfamy which they may cauſe; he muſt neceſſarily be impudent who is preſſing and importunate; ſeeing he takes a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty beyond good manners, and that he fears not the blame which his ſhameleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deſerves.</p>
                        <p>But if deſire cauſe boldneſs, how can it then render a man <hi>Baſe and Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous?</hi> It may be ſaid 'tis done at ſeveral times; That ſometimes we fancy the things we deſire are eaſily obtained, and that ſometimes there are great obſtacles to be overcome; and that as theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thoughts enter the minde, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce either Boldneſs or Fear, Hope or Deſpair. Now although this be true, it is alſo evident, that that Boldneſs which breeds Impudence, is not always incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with Baſeneſs; if it apprehend not infamy, it may fear every other thing; and we cannot doubt but thoſe who ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite with ſo much urgency and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a perſon inferior to them, are poſſeſt with a very cowardly Boldneſs, and a baſe and ſervile Impudency.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Diſquiet, Impatience, and Irreſolution,</hi> are alſo inſeparable from Deſire; for the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47499:155"/>minde ſeeing it ſelf deprived of the good ſhe imagined neceſſary for her, can take no reſt til ſhe hath obtained it. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which retard its enjoyment ſeem years and ages, the leaſt impediments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear great obſtacles, and all the means ſhe findes to make her the ſooner enjoy the deſired good, are in her opinion weak and unprofitable: ſo that forming at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment new deſignes, heaping de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires upon deſires, and increaſing difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by her irreſolutions ſhe unceſſantly agitates and diſquiets herſelf, and findes not even in their poſſeſſion the end of her troubles, as we have ſhewed in the diſcourſe of Joy.</p>
                        <p>But whenee comes it that <hi>Deſires do thus encreaſe and multiply,</hi> and that like waves they follow and drive one the other that obſtacles make them encreaſe, and that they have no bounds which can contain them? It is true that the greateſt part of our deſires are of that Nature that they cannot be bounded, and that they become infinite; but there are others alſo which never paſs their juſt extent.</p>
                        <p>To know the reaſon of this difference, you muſt ſuppoſe that there are deſires neceſſary for this life, and others which
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47499:156"/>are not ſo; thoſe are common to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and are inſpired by Nature, theſe are proper to man, and proceed from the opinion and choice he makes, not onely of neceſſity, but alſo of ſuperfluous things. The firſt have their certain bounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Nature who leads them is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a certain end, from which ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtraggles, and wherein ſhe findes her reſt when ſhe is there arrived; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are infinite; for aſmuch as the will whence they originally come is an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal power, which is not to be filled but by the poſſeſſion of all things; and which being unable to be ſatisfied by any one, inceſſantly runs from one to another, and forms as many deſires as there are goods whersof ſhe is in want; it is not that all the deſires which part from our choice are infinite; when they are ruled by right reaſon, they have alſo their bounds, and we may alſo be ſure that they are as natural and as neceſſary as thoſe which ſerve ths neceſſities of life: For right reaſon being nothing elſe but what is convenient for the Nature of man, the Deſires which are regulated thereby, are as it were natural, and by ſo much the more neceſſary, as they ſerve the nobleſt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47499:156"/>part which is in him. But this belongs to another Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>Let us now ſee, why <hi>Difficulty provokes Deſire;</hi> it is not that by putting of the Soul further off from the good ſhe thought readily to enjoy, ſhe obligeth her to uſe the more endeavour to draw neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto it, or elſe the impediments inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring new deſignes, give it alſo new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for Deſire, which uniting it ſelf to the former, make the Paſſion appear the greater; but theſe Paſſions are not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; for they ſuppoſe we alwayes wiſh the good, before theſe impediments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves; and in the mean time it is true, that difficulty and reſiſtance doe often breed a deſire of certain things which we had never ſought, how deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoever they were, had they not been forbidden us, and difficult. We muſt then conclude that the firſt ſource of this effect proceeds from the natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in man for his liberty, and his own proper excellency: for being a creature naturally free and glorious, he beleeves that difficulties reproach him his weakneſs, and that prohibition wounds his liberty; wherefore when either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf, he raiſeth himſelf againſt it,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:47499:157"/>and thinks that bearing himſelf towards the good, againſt which they conteſt with him, he preſents thoſe advantages which he received from Nature. Thus far in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Moral actions: let us now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Corporal Characters.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are of two kindes as is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſome by the command of the minde, others purely natural, and happen by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. The firſt are ſwelling eyes and urgent looks, the trembling of the tongue, watry mouth, ſeveral inflections of the voice, talk and ſilence, the agitation and motion of the Body.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Eyes and Looks,</hi> which are proper to deſires, are not onely fixed and ſetled on their objects; for meditation and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the minde may procure that; but there is alſo a certain ardor and vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which makes them come outwards, and ſeems to throw them on the thing deſired; which happens not to thoſe who meditate, whoſe eyes ſink and grow dim, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth, and as we ſhall ſay in its due place. Theſe Looks then which the Latins ſo happily call <hi>Inſtantes, Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; Devorantes,</hi> that is to ſay, Preſſing, Greedy, and Devouring, whence even that vulgar manner of ſpeaking comes, <hi>he
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47499:157"/>feeds on him with his eyes;</hi> that is to ſay, he looks on him with ardor. Thoſe looks are the true images of Deſire, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely a tranſport and a ſally which the Soul makes towards Good, imprint the ſame darting in the eyes, which are the moſt mobile and the moſt obedient parts of the body, caſting them out as much as ſhe can, and as much as they can ſuffer it: Beſides, that the ſpirits which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly run thither, and would go out, drive them forward to make themſelves way, and fill them with the luſtre and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity which we perceive in them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>trembling of the tongue</hi> and <hi>a watry mouth,</hi> are effects which ſerve for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of Aliments: for the Soul, which hath a ſecret knowledge of what is uſeful for its deſignes, knowing that taſting can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without humidity, and that the motion of the tongue is neceſſary to ſend aliments down into the ſtomack, brings this water into the mouth, and ſtirs the tongue, when we ſee the things we deſire, or hear them ſpoken of; the Fancie in ſome manner rendring them preſent, and cauſing the organs to do the ſame thing they would do if they were really on the tongue.</p>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:47499:158"/>
                        <p>But whence comes this <hi>clear und ſubtil water?</hi> Doth it not deſcend from thoſe kirnels which are in the bottom of the mouth, whoſe chief uſe is to receive the ſuperfluous humours of the brain, and to diſperſe them on the tongue to moiſten it? It is evident it commonly proves ſo, and that the motion of the ſpirits which the Deſire brings into thoſe parts, opens the paſſages, and makes theſe waters run the more. But it often alſo happens, that they come from the ſtomack, either by the means of thoſe wandring ſpirits which run thither to cauſe digeſtion, or by the contraction of its fibers which ſqueeze the humour wherewith they are watered, and raiſe it up on high: for in Deſires they ſometimes contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much, that they even overthrow the ſtomack; and principally in fiſh, who naturally are all gluttonous, and who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their prey too ardently, cauſe it to run out of its place, and caſt it ſometimes even into their mouthes. However it be, we muſt believe that theſe two effects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the deſire of Aliments, and that the Soul hath ſome reaſon to employ them to that uſe. But when ſhe makes them ſerve other deſires, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47499:158"/>it is an errour which comes from its blindneſs and precipitation, and which perſwades that that which is neceſſary for one deſigne may alſo be ſo for another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed it be quite uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſeveral inflexions of the voice</hi> which are obſerved in Deſire, do not all proceed from it: As it mixeth it ſelf with other Paſſions, it borrows from them the ſounds and the accents which are familiar to them. Sometimes it lifts it up with Boldneſs and Anger, ſometimes it lets it fall with Fear and Languor; ſometimes it cuts it with grief and aſtoniſhment, other times it draws it out with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and joy. But the change which this alone ſeems to give, is the precipitation of words, and the long exclamations which commence its diſcourſes: For the force which follows this Paſſion, cauſeth the words to go out in a croud; and the darting forth of the Soul cauſeth a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the voice, which is always made by the ſtrongeſt vowels, which moſt of all open the mouth; as if ſhe would make a freer paſſage, that ſhe might iſſue out the more readily. In effect, we never finde the I nor the U in the ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of Deſire, but onely A, O, and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47499:159"/>E, which ſhe alſo chargeth with vehement aſpirations which ſhew the force ſhe uſeth in iſſuing forth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Silence,</hi> and <hi>confuſion of diſcourſe,</hi> are the effects of a great diſtraction of the Minde, which is common to thoſe who ardently deſire a thing, when we ſpeak not to them of their Paſſion, or when they are with perſons which cannot ſerve them therein: For the Soul quitting with regret the thought of the Good ſhe wants, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly ſeeking the means to poſſeſs it, flees the converſation which might trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her pleaſure and her deſigne; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entring in her ſelf, or rather wandring in the purſuit ſhe makes, ſhe hears not what others ſay, ſhe ſilenceth her ſelf, or makes diſorderly anſwers. And her tranſport riſeth often to that exceſs, that it takes away the uſe of the Senſes, and even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſheth her into an extaſie, as we ſhewed in our Diſcourſe of Love.</p>
                        <p>For what concerns the <hi>agitation of the body,</hi> it follows the diſquiet or the motion which the ſoul makes towards Good: for when he who is troubled with this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on changeth every moment his poſture and his place, caſts about his eyes here and there, turns now on one ſide, now on the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47499:159"/>other; now riſeth, now ſits; goes, and ſtops ever and anon: they are the effects of his irreſolutions, and the divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes which his diſquiet propoſeth: But if he reacheth out his head, if he ſtretch out his arms towards the deſired object, if he goes and walks with large paces, and runs towards it; they are endeavours which the Soul cauſeth the parts to make to draw neer the good which is diſtant from it. For although they are often uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in the errour ſhe is ſhe ſtill believes ſhe goes forward, and that caſting the eyes, the head and hands towards what ſhe deſires, it is as much ground gotten, and that at laſt ſhe ſhall arrive at the end ſhe tends to.</p>
                        <p>We have nothing more here to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but the neceſſary effects of Deſire. But as the moſt part of them are to be found in thoſe Paſſions of which we have already ſpoken, we ſhall without difficulty enquire the reaſons, and ſend back the Reader to the place whence we deduced them: For <hi>ſighs and extaſies, loſs of ſpeech, ſleep and appetite,</hi> have herein no other cauſes but as in Love. <hi>The face grows red and ſwell'd</hi> by the arrival of blood and ſpirits which caſt themſelves on the outward parts, as
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47499:160"/>is already ſaid. <hi>Tears</hi> proceed from grief which the privation of Good too atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſidered, breeds in the Minde.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>motion of the heart and arteries is great,</hi> becauſe the ſoul endeavours to open them, to ſend forth a quantity of ſpirits; <hi>frequent,</hi> becauſe of the violence and haſte it makes to get them out; and <hi>unequal,</hi> by the mixture of other Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>body grows lean and dry,</hi> becauſe thoſe parts which digeſt the humours, and thoſe which are to be nouriſhed by them, being weakned by the flight of the ſpirits, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it not as they ought and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them into their ſubſtance, as was ſaid in the Diſcourſe of Love.</p>
                        <p>There remains nothing now but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Deſire, which, being extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, deſerves a longer examen then the former: It is, that a <hi>too ardent Deſire makes a man grow old in a day,</hi> as <hi>Theorictus;</hi> that is to ſay, makes the hair gray in a ſhort time, according to the ordinary explication of that paſſage. For my part, I muſt confeſs that the obſervation is particular enough, and I do not remember that I have ſeen it anywhere but in that Author. But ſince the ſame thing happens in Fear and in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, which in a night change the hair,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:47499:160"/>and that cares and diſpleaſures make a man grow gray before his time, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but Deſire may ſometimes cauſe the ſame effect: all the difficulty is to know how it may be done.</p>
                        <p>You muſt then ſuppoſe with <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> that hair grows gray for want of heat fit and natural for it; that it then ſuffers a kind of corruption and rottenneſs, and that it happens as to all other things that in corrupting it turns white: in effect we cannot deny but that it is the old age of the hair. And ſince that of all the body happens from the diminution of natural heat, it is likely it proceeds from the ſame cauſe; when this heat then diminiſheth it produceth two effects in the hair; for the aliment which ought to nouriſh it, digeſts not but flies, into vapours, and the air fills the place of the Spirits. Now vapours contain much air, and air is the firſt cauſe of whiteneſs, as we ſee in ſcum; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth us, that to make the hair white, we muſt wet and expoſe it to the air.</p>
                        <p>And it is true that heat growing weak, either by little and little, or ſuddenly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion is the chief cauſe of whiteneſs of hair, when the heat is conſumed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:47499:161"/>grees; but when it readily diſſipates, as it happens in ſickneſſeſs and vehement Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is chiefly the air which whitens it ſliding into the pores, and taking the place of the retired ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>Some will ſay, If this be true, the hair of dead men ſhould be always white; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat being extinct, and the air en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironing them, might eaſily inſinuate it ſelf into its pores.</p>
                        <p>To this it muſt be anſwered, that after death there remains a natural heat in the hair, as in the bones, which are long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved after the expiration of the creature whoſe parts they were. But this heat is immoveable, and incapable of any frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, being deprived of the ſouls influence, which gave it efficacie and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So there are no more crudities made, becauſe the aliments riſe no more thither, and the air cannot occupie the place of the ſpirits which are there fixt and ſtopt.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, we cannot but confeſs that the ſoul inſpires ſome vertue into thoſe parts, that ſhe takes ſome care of them, and that ſhe governs them as ſhe pleaſeth; otherwiſe, what ſhould cauſe that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and regular painting in the plumage
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:47499:161"/>of Birds? what ſhould ſo juſtly compaſs the eye-brows? what ſhould ſo carefully regulate the hair of the eye-lids? laſtly, what ſhould cauſe all that ſo wel meaſur'd a diverſity which is to be obſerved in the hair of beaſts? As that commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the ſpecies of every creature, it muſt needs be, that the ſoul wherein it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, conduceth alſo to this work, and that ſhe at her pleaſure diſpoſeth of thoſe parts wherein ſhe cauſeth ſo many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. This being granted, it is not hard to ſay how Fear, Deſire and Cares may change the hair: for, in retiring the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they derive it of the influence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them; they dry up that ſpring of life which did riſe to its roots, and draw away that vital heat which ran thorow its pores.</p>
                        <p>It is true, this ſeldom happens, and there muſt be a great violence and a great diſpoſition to produce this effect. For there are certain actions from which it is very difficult to withdraw Nature; and what tempeſt ſoever happens to it, ſhe but ſeldome forſakes their rudder and conduct. Such are the functions of the Vegetative ſoul, which are principally made by the means of the fixt ſpirits; and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47499:162"/>being not ſubject to the power of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or of the Appetite, remain qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, whilſt the others erre here and there, and are agitated by the ſeveral motions which the Paſſions impreſs. But yet it ſometimes happens, that, by reaſon of the conjunction which there is between the parts of the ſoul, the diſorders of the one are communicated to the other; and that the Natural faculty is carried away by the Senſitive, principally in thoſe whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are more mobile, and the ſubſtance of their parts more ſoft. So that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe imagination is very ſtrong, and who have the weakeſt brain, more eaſily grow gray then other men, by the violence of thoſe Paſſions which we have ſpoken of.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>The Characters of</hi> Hope.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E who gave away all he had, and reſerved onely Hope, made not ſo ill a bargain as it may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: He took for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that which is the ſweeteſt in life, the moſt durable Good which can be found therein. In a word, we may ſay, that he had for his ſhare all what he had not, and that he truely divided for himſelf like a King.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, as there are no other Goods whereof we are ſenſible, but thoſe which we poſſeſs, and thoſe which we hope for; it is certain, that poſſeſſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords not a perfect contentment here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, for that it cloys the Minde, and takes away the knowledge of the good it
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47499:163"/>poſſeſſeth, that it even corrupts the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, and ſtraight begets a diſtaſte. But Hope, which awakens the Minde, and renders it clearer-ſighted, repreſents the Good as it is, ſhews it in its purity, and gives a far more delicious taſte of it then Enjoyment can: For it is ſo ingenious, that it ſeparates it ſelf from all the Ills which are mixt with it; it purifies it ſelf from all the defects which accompany it: and as we may ſay, that it is then the flower of Goodneſs which it pours into our ſoul; we may alſo ſay, that the Joy it diſperſeth therein is the flower of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the moſt refined ſweetneſs of Delight. Why ſhould we then wonder, finding it ſo ſweet and delightful, if we enter it into all our deſignes, if we mix it with all our actions, and if it be the laſt thing we abandon during life? 'Tis what alone ſweetens the ſharpneſs and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, which patiently makes us bear the diſgraces thereof; and of all the good things which may accrue thereunto, this is the onely one which is compatible with thoſe miſeries whereunto it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: For, ſhould all ills overwhelm a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhould all miſchances and calamities which we can imagine faſten on him, he
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47499:163"/>yet may have Hope, which perhaps alone may be worth more to him then all other Goods can be without it.</p>
                     <p>Of a truth, alſo, it is of all the Paſſions the moſt natural to Man: he is ſenſible of its growth, as he grows in perfection; and feels it weaken, when he fails in that. He ceaſeth to live, when he ceaſeth to hope; and, to ſpeak ſoberly, there is none but he alone that hopes: for all other creatures have no more but a ſhadow of Hope, as they have of Reaſon; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences ſcarce know it: And when Man paſſeth into their nature, although he ſtill be capable of Love or of Hatred, of Joy or of Grief, of Fear or of Deſpair, yet is he no longer capable of Hope.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, ſince it is that which leads us to felicity, and which gives us the firſt taſte of it, it would be uſeleſs to thoſe who are already happie, and to thoſe which cannot be ſo: And Man, who alone is in the way of felicity, ought alſo to be onely touched with this Paſſion. In the tempeſts wherewith his life is continually agitated, it was neceſſary that Hope ſhould be his lanthorn, and the ſtar to lead him to his laſt port; and that in the length and dangers of his voyage, he might at leaſt
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47499:164"/>have the ſatisfaction to ſee afar off the end he tends to, and to poſſeſs in Idea and by way of advance the happineſs he aſpires to. For Nature, who never ſuffers things to arrive at once at their laſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, would have Man here belowe have ſome ſenſibleneſs of his, that he might as it were make 'ſay and taſte, if we may ſo ſpeak, of the Soveraign Good, before he ſhould perfectly poſſeſs it.</p>
                     <p>But ſince that is the true uſe of Hope, we ought not otherwiſe to employ nor abuſe ſo noble an help, in purſuit of ſo many vain things which occupie our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and which are unworthy of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of our Mindes. That which is deſtined to nouriſh and breed up Vertue, muſt not ſerve for the nouriſhment and ſubſiſtence of Vice; and that which ought to lead us to Felicity, ſhould not eſtrange us from it, and precipitate us into miſery. For it is certain, that if Hope be not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Reaſon, there are no ill deſignes formed, nor evil actions performed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are there any ill habits which take not their beginning and their growth from it: It is the ſeed of all the evil which is committed in the world; it is the ſource of all the miſeries which flow thither:
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47499:164"/>and in Truth, as well as in the Fable, it may paſs for one of the greateſt miſchiefs which befel Mankinde. Whatever it be, it is moſt true, that their weakneſs is in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more diſcovered, ſince, as the Wiſe man ſays, all their hopes are but a light froth, which the tempeſt diſſipates in a moment; but a ſmoke, which the winde carrieth away; and but a dream, which troubles our life with fantaſms and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera's. But we muſt leave theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Divinity, and ſee whether we can deſcribe the Characters of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>The Poets had reaſon to feign that Hope onely remained in the bottom of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s box: for it is certainly hid in the very bottom of the ſoul: It iſſues not forth as the others do; all its endeavours are ſecret; and the trouble it cauſeth may be compared to thoſe tempeſts which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten riſe in full ſea, without troubling the ſhore: What violence ſoever it brings, what ſtir ſoever it cauſeth, nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears outwardly; and, did not other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions mix themſelves with it, it would be very hard to diſcover it. Indeed, he that hopes is always amongſt the diſquiets of Deſire: and the raviſhments of Joy, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47499:165"/>and Satisfaction equally dividing his Minde; and the privation of good, with the imaginary enjoyment he hath thereof, cauſe a certain mixture of diſpleaſure and delight, which at once almoſt renders him content and diſpleaſed. But this chiefly happens when his Hopes are uncertain: for the difficulties which are then greater, figure unto him the ſucceſs the more doubtful; mixing Fear with his Deſires, and Deſpair with his Fear: Then all at once relevating his courage, and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſignes with a favourable event, all his apprehenſions vaniſh, and give way to Boldneſs, Joy, and Perſeverance: He no more mindes thoſe obſtacles which aſtoniſhed him before; at leaſt, after he hath meaſured them with his ſtrength, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath ſeen them overcome by others, and that he may be as happie as they have been; he eaſily believes to compaſs it, and that it is ſufficient to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a great matter, to oblige Fortune. He remembers himſelf of all the graces that ever he received from her; he in the ſame manner perſwades himſelf that he deſerved them, and that he ought not to expect leſs; and that having now more credit and power then ever he had,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47499:165"/>he ought not to doubt of the ſucceſs he hopes for. He eſteems all thoſe which may ſerve him in this occaſion: ſome he believes are obliged to it by duty or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; others, by affection or honour. In fine, he promiſeth himſelf the aſſiſtance of all thoſe which he hath ſeen, or heard ſpoken of. And weaving thus intricacies with intricacies, he imagines his deſignes infallible, and that they ought to ſucceed according as he hath projected them: as if he were already maſter of the Good he ſeeks, he thinks he hath the abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal thereof: He deſtines thoſe who ſhall ſhare in his good ſucceſs, and marks thoſe who are to be excluded: and thus making whom he will happy or unhappy, he believes himſelf the diſpenſor of the favours and diſgraces of his fortune, thence he grows preſumptuous, raſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent; he fancies there is nothing that can reſiſt him, nothing he ought not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: He deſpiſeth the deſignes of a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous man, and the purſuits of a rival; and, as if they ought no longer to pretend to what they hope for, he ſcorns their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and laughs at their deſpair. In this aſſurance he abandons the care of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he no longer mindes his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47499:166"/>and, without taking heed of the ambuſhes prepared for him, he by his negligence loſeth the good he aſſured himſelf of, and often triumphs over an enemy who hath already gotten the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over him. In fine, he becomes vain, importunate, and ridiculous; he continually ſpeaks of the ſervices he hath rendered, of the recompences he hath merited, of the means he hath to oblige all the world. If you will believe him, there is none but he can procure graces and favours; they belong to him onely, and he alone alſo who can revenge himſelf if he ſhould be refuſed: Hereupon, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that in effect he may meet with a check, he becomes peeviſh, and grows angry: To ſome, he reproacheth their negligence, or their ingratitude; to others, their baſeneſs or perfidiouſneſs: and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not knowing upon what to fall, he accuſeth Heaven and Fortune for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which perhaps will never befal him.</p>
                     <p>Thus far Hope carries us, when it is unbridled. Yet muſt we not believe that it makes this progreſs ſucceſſively with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption; ſuſpition and miſtruſt traverſe it every moment; Fear at every
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47499:166"/>ſtep retains it, Deſpair ſometimes ſtops it all at once; Deſire and Boldneſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding preſently after, it findes it ſelf continually carried away, and reſtrained by contrary motions: and of the calmeſt of all the Paſſions, which it is, it appears the moſt unquiet and the moſt turbulent. But to ſpeak truth, we ought not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it for theſe ſtorms; it is the Paſſions which follow its train: And if there be any thing which it can do alone, it is, that it eſtabliſheth the Minde againſt thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficulties which appear in the ſearch of Good. So that it was not without reaſon figured with an Anchor, which truly ſtays ſhips, but yet hinders them not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill agitated by waves and tempeſts. However, Hope hath no outward Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter particular to it; and that which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies it, is but a confuſed mixture of touches which the other motions of the Soul imprint on the body. It may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to thoſe ingenious Pictures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeveral figures are ſeen to repreſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other which is not there painted: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you may therein obſerve the marks of Deſire, of Joy and Boldneſs, and often thoſe of Fear, of Deſpair, and of Grief; yet all that repreſents nothing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47499:167"/>elſe but Hope. Indeed, when it begins to be felt, it raviſheth the body, lifts up the head, raiſeth the brow, the voice grows firm, the looks aſſured: And in that air which hath ſomewhat of ſevere in it, you may perceive a moderate Joy which ſweetens the eyes, a certain ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which ſheds it ſelf upon the face, and a blithe vivacity which animates all its actions. But this Calm laſts not long; from time to time impatience and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet diſturb it: They caſt their looks here and there, ſometimes ſend them up towards heaven; they ſigh at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they cannot ſtay in a place: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they grow peeviſh and doating; they grow pale, they loſe courage: Then, by little and little retaking their firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, they feel their forces augment, they finde themſelves heated with a new ardor; they come, they go, they leap; they are in perpetual agitation. But, to ſpeak home, theſe later ſallies come not from Hope: As it is a Paſſion which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is the moſt moderate of all, it never riſeth to theſe exceſſes: All the motions it cauſeth, are without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and without precipitation: It renders the Pulſe firm, without being
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:47499:167"/>vehement; the Reſpiration ſtrong, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force: It fortifies the actions of all the parts: It awakens languiſhing Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it retains thoſe which are impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Finally, it is the moſt uſeful of them all, for Vertue, and for Health: Let us therefore enquire what its nature is, and how it produceth all theſe effects.</p>
                     <div n="2" type="part">

                        <head>PART 2. <hi>Of the nature of</hi> Hope.</head>
                        <p>HOpe is ſo fine and delicate a thing, which forms and ruines it ſelf by ſuch weak means, which ſo ſubtilly mixeth it ſelf with other Paſſions, and which ſhews it ſelf ſo little, as we have ſaid, that thoſe who have enquired the nature thereof, are to be excuſed if they have not encountred it. Indeed, the alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it hath with Deſire and Boldneſs is ſo great, that it is very hard to ſeparate them, and to diſcern the motion which is proper to every of them: For Boldneſs is never without Hope, nor Hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deſire. Beſides, the action of the Imaginative faculty glitters ſo much in this Paſſion, that that of the Appetite ſcarce appears: and that is the reaſon ſome have defined it by <hi>the expectation of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:47499:168"/>good,</hi> which is a pure effect of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as being nothing but a belief and an opinion which we have of a good to come.</p>
                        <p>But beſides that we may expect Good without hoping for it, as we will ſhew anon, Hope would not then be a Paſſion, being no motion of the Appetite. As for thoſe who have placed it in the rank of Paſſions, ſome have ſaid that it was the conſummation and the perfection of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: Others, that it was a certain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we had that the deſired good would come. But the firſt confound it with Deſire, the others with Boldneſs: or at leaſt, if Confidence be a kinde of Hope, as it is moſt likely, it were to define the gender by the ſpecies, and an obſcure thing by one which is leſs known. In a word, all the definitions are faulty, being either too much ſtretched, or too much contracted; and none of them obſerve the particular motion wherewith the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is agitated in this Paſſion; which nevertheleſs alone makes all its eſſence, and without which it is impoſſible to know its nature. We muſt then make it our Ground, that Hope reſpects but good to come, and that Deſire always precedes
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:47499:169"/>it, foraſmuch as Deſire is the firſt motion which the ſoul makes towards that kinde of good, and that we never hope for any thing, without having deſired it before. But becauſe there are alſo thoſe which we deſire, which we cannot hope for, (for well may we wiſh for Beauty, Knowledge, Glory, Scepters, and Diadems, which are moſt commonly beyond our hopes) that makes us judge them two different Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that their objects, motives and motions ought alſo to be different.</p>
                        <p>Now it is not enough for the object of Hope, that the things be thought poſſible, (for they have that of common with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as we have ſaid;) but beſides that, we muſt believe that they will effectually happen. Yet this belief is not moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible; for we never hope for thoſe things which neceſſarily are to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; but they muſt be doubtful, and we muſt imagine that there are difficulties to obtain them. But where can the difficulty be? For it is not always to be found in the things we hope for, ſince there are ſome which move that Paſſion, which yet are very eaſie; not in the means we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to acquire them, being often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty to be performed.</p>
                        <pb n="303" facs="tcp:47499:169"/>
                        <p>We may then ſay, that in the things we hope, we always imagine we can never enjoy them but by the means of ſome other man, whether in effect he labour to make us obtain them, or that he no ways hinder us: For it is certain, that if they were wholly in our own power, and did we believe that nothing could hinder us from the poſſeſſion of them, they could never beget Hope in us; and the Soul would be content to adde to the Deſire, which ſhe would then form faith and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that it would happen; which is an effect of the Judgement, and not of the Appetite.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty then in Hope, comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from a third, which is as the <hi>medium</hi> betwixt him who hopes, and the thing hoped for; in whoſe liberty we ſuppoſe it is, to do or not to do what we hope. For although we ſhould often hope good from thoſe things which do not freely operate, even from thoſe things which are inanimate; as when we hope that Lands will be fertile, and that Seaſons will be pleaſant; that a beaſt will delight us, or be ſerviceable to us: we fancie them to our ſelves as if they had that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; whether it be that there is in beaſts
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:47499:170"/>an image of true liberty, or for that we have a natural inſtinct which ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us that there is a Superiour power in the world, which diſpoſeth thereof at will, and according as it thinks fit: So that what we hope depending from the will of others whoſe maſters we cannot abſolutely be, it is impoſſible but we muſt eſteem it difficult, and but that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs muſt ſeem doubtful. It is not but that ſometimes the difficulty may be in the thing it ſelf we deſire, and the means we uſe to obtain it: but it is not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this Paſſion, being not eſſential to it. However, from what part ſoever it comes, we muſt take it for granted that it is neceſſary to form Hope. Let us now ſee what its deſigne is, and what the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is which it cauſeth in the Appetite.</p>
                        <p>All the difficulties preſented to the Soul, either in the ſearch of Good, or aſſault and flight of Ill, appear greater or leſs then its forces; that is to ſay, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhe can overcome them, or that ſhe cannot reſiſt them: If they are the weaker, they beget Hope, Boldneſs, and Anger; if they are the greater, they cauſe Deſpair and Fear. Now it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that in difficulties the Soul doth in it
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47499:170"/>ſelf what we outwardly do when they preſent themſelves to us: For as we bend our ſelves againſt them, if we ſuppoſe we can overcome them; and as we loſe ſtrength and courage, if they appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible; it muſt needs be, ſince the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the body follow thoſe of the ſoul, and that there is ſome relation and reſemblance between them, that the ſoul bends or ſlackens her ſelf as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth, in the encounter of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhe fancies. And indeed, it is the onely difference which can diſtinguiſh the motions of the Iraſcible appetite from thoſe of the Concupiſcible: For in theſe the Soul hath no occaſion to employ her force or courage, ſeeing no enemy ſhe ought to aſſault, or againſt whom ſhe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to defend her ſelf. Or if ſhe purſue Good, or flee from Ill, it is without bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſlackning her ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Since it is then a thing common to Hope, Boldneſs, and Anger, to bend the Soul againſt difficulties; let us ſee wherein they are different; and chiefly, what Hope hath particularly therein, it being the ſubject of this Diſcourſe. We muſt then ſuppoſe that in Hope the Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly obſerves the Good, but confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47499:171"/>ſees the difficulties: on the contrary, in Boldneſs and Anger it conſiders the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties more then the good. For although in theſe the ſoul aſſaults ill, to enjoy the good ſhe expects by victory, ſhe chiefly ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her thoughts on the enemy ſhe fights againſt, and thinks onely on the good which ſhall thereby accrue, but as a thing at a diſtance, which provokes not as the preſence of ill doth. But in Hope, ſhe neerly faceth the good which preſents it ſelf; ſhe attentively conſiders it, and ſees but by the way the difficulties which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege her; ſo that they do not appear ſo great, and conſequently do not oblige her to uſe ſuch endeavours to reſiſt them as in other Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>Indeed in Boldneſs and Anger ſhe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up and aſſaults the ill, becauſe ſhe thinks it ſo powerful, that ſhe believe ſhe cannot overcome it without aſſault or combat: But in Hope it appears not ſo ſtrong, as that it ought to be aſſaulted; nor ſo weak, as to be ſlighted: She keeps her ſelf in a certain mean betwixt heat and neglect; and, without animating her ſelf gainſt it, ſhe puts herſelf in ſafety, &amp; ſtands upon her guard: which ſhe doth in ſtiffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fortifying her ſelf in her ſelf; as it
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47499:171"/>happens to the body, which, its parts being all equally ſtretched, without changing place, and almoſt without moving, makes a vigorous motion, which keeps it firm and extended; which for that cauſe is called in the Schools, <hi>The Tonick motion;</hi> The Soul then doth the ſame in this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; without aſſaulting or fleeing the ill which might traverſe it, ſhe fortifies her ſelf, ſtands on her guard, and with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance expects the good ſhe ſeeks. So that we may define it to be <hi>A motion of the Appetite, in which the Soul, in expectation of the good it deſires, ſtrengthens and ſtiffens her ſelf in her ſelf, to reſiſt the difficulties ſhe may encounter therein.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed, the whole nature, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conditions required in Hope, are contained in this definition. Deſire and Expectation, which conſiſt in the opinion that the good will come, are marked as the neceſſary conditions which always precede it; the deſired good, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which moves it; the appetite, as the ſubject where it is received; and that firm aſſurance, as the difference of the emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is proper to it, and which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth it from all other Paſſions. For although Boldneſs and Anger ſtiffen the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:47499:172"/>ſoul alſo, as we have ſaid, yet are they not content to keep it fixed in it ſelf; they make it riſe up, and drive it againſt the ill, and force it to fight with it.</p>
                        <p>But this breeds a very reaſonable doubt: for, did the ſoul keep it ſelf ſtiff &amp; ſteady in Boldneſs &amp; Anger, as ſhe doth in Hope, it would follow that Hope muſt always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them: And yet it is true; a man may caſt himſelf into danger without hope of ever getting out; and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we deſire to be revenged of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury whereof we know we ſhall never have ſatisfaction: yet it hinders not but that this propoſition is moſt certain, and but that it is true that Boldneſs and Anger are ever accompanied with Hope: For it is not always the onely good which Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs propoſeth, to get out of the danger which it caſts it ſelf into; honour and glory, which ſpring from generous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are often the Goods it aſpires to, and the enjoyment of which it always hopes, what miſchance ſoever happens to it: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it fall under the difficulties it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, it ſtill thinks 't will be to overcome them, if they do but ſerve to obtain what it pretends to; as in the Diſcourſe of Boldneſs we ſhall more fully ſhew.</p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:47499:172"/>
                        <p>For Anger, we will in its place make it appear, that the ſatisfaction it expects in Revenge, and the principal end Nature hath aſſigned it, is to hinder the thing which injures us from continuing to do ſo: ſo that what can ſtop the courſe and continuance of the III, appeaſeth Anger; and we are ſatisfied, when he who hath offended us repents himſelf of it, when he acknowledgeth that it was not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, when he flees, or when he hath been hurt; for that then it appears that he wants either power or will to miſchief us, or elſe we ſuppoſe we have taken them from him. This then is the ſatisfaction which Anger always promiſeth it ſelf: and if it happen that we deſpair of obtaining it, as, when the things which offend us appear ſo powerful to us, that they ſeem beyond our ſtrength and endeavours, and that we have no hope to be able to ſtop the malice they have to injure us; we are then no longer capable of Anger, having loſt our hope to be avenged, that is to ſay, to beat back the ill on him who cauſed it, that he may ceaſe to do us more. If there be then a ſatisfaction which Revenge is out of hope to obtain, it is not natural to the Paſſion; it muſt be a ſtranger, as what
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47499:173"/>comes from the cuſtom of the Country, from the humour of the perſon, from the weakneſs of judgement, and the like. But this ſhall be in its place more carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. Let us betake our ſelves to our former Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>The Soul then ſtiffens it ſelf in Hope, and in ſome ſort ſuffers that Tonick moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which (as we have ſhewn) happens to the body. But we may ſay, that what image ſoever this example may give of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherewith the appetite is moved, it doth not fully ſatisfie the Mind, and leaves always in it a difficulty to conceive how the Soul can move ſo: For it is not as of Bodies, which have nerves and muſcles, which ſtretch the parts, and keep them extended, drawing them equally on every ſide: We can imagine nothing like it in the Soul, which is wholly ſimple, and which would rather ſuffer to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſubtil and fluid bodies, which this effect cannot reach, then to thoſe who are maſſive and heavie, where it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly performed.</p>
                        <p>Now although this be true, yet it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys not our propoſition: for it's certain, the Soul ſtiffens it ſelf aſwel as the Body, but that the manner is quite different. It
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47499:173"/>is not always neceſſary that the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be made in the ſame manner: and we ſee that creatures bend and ſtretch out their bodies, although by different means. Amongſt thoſe which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the muſcles perform this effect by contracting and looſing themſelves: But there are divers in whom theſe parts are wanting, as in thoſe which are ſo little, that we can ſcarce diſcern them, and in which moſt likely it is the ſpirits and the nerves alone perform theſe actions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of other organs. There are a thouſand other examples in Nature, which clearly manifeſt this truth; but were there none, the Schools teach us, that ſpiritual ſubſtances carry themſelves from one place to another; that they may occupie more or leſs room; that they drive and draw bodies; that, in ſine, they perform almoſt all the motions which we obſerve in animate bodies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the manner and the means be quite contrary. Which being granted, we ought not to doubt but that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite can ſtiffen it ſelf as well as living parts; it being needleſs it ſhould do it in the ſame manner, or by the ſame means as they are uſually accuſtomed to do.</p>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:47499:174"/>
                        <p>But if it were enquired what this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, and what particular means the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite uſeth in this motion; we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it to be a bold enquiry, to which it ſeems the minde of man is not able to give ſatisfaction: For ſince its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedge, how high ſoever it be, draws its origine from that of the Senſes, how can it have any in thoſe things, when the Senſes forſake it? How can it diſcern the ways Nature takes in the motions of the Soul which are not ſenſible, when it is ignorant of thoſe it keeps in them of the body, which touch the Senſes, and are viſible to our eyes? Indeed, all our Philoſophy muſt confeſs, that it toucheth but the extremities of motions, and that it almoſt never ſpeaks of what paſſeth between both. And we may ſay, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſo freely gives all things, ſeems to be jealous of the art wherewith ſhe doth them, and is unwilling we ſhould ſee the ſprings of her works. However it be, I believe more cannot be aſſured in this matter, then that the ſoul ſtiffens it ſelf in exciting and quickning its vigour, and putting it, as the School ſays, out of the power into act. And truely, ſince An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick natures can move and even tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47499:174"/>bodies from one place to another, it muſt be granted that they give to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp; to them alſo, a certain impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which changeth the ſituation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence they had; ſome particular vertue muſt diſperſe it ſelf whereſoever they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, which renders them ſtronger &amp; more agile: and this vertue, according to my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is nothing but their Will, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> moves it ſelf; or elſe their very motion: for things get a force in motion which they have not in reſt. The ſame thing may proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſaid of the Appetite, which is the firſt moving power in creatures: For by exciting it ſelf, it agitates &amp; corroborates it ſelf; and being agitated with an equal and uniform motion, which holds it ſo ſuſpended, without advance or receſs; it remains ſtiff &amp; ſtedfaſt, to oppoſe the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which may preſent themſelvs. But, without engaging our ſelves further in this enquiry, which exceeds the limits of our deſigne, it will be ſufficient to take away a difficulty which ſprings from what we have already ſaid.</p>
                        <p>For if this motion of the Appetite be onely an equal and uniform agitation, whereby the ſoul remains fixt in it ſelf, without advancing or receding; it muſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:47499:175"/>follow, that Deſire can never be with Hope, ſince it darts out the ſoul, and drives it out of it ſelf, and that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains it. We muſt then ſay, that it is true, Deſire is not always with Hope, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it always precedes it. And indeed, when we deſire any thing ardently, we perceive that Hope ſlackens it ſelf; as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire alſo diminiſheth, when Hope increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Certainly they deſtroy one the other when they meet; Foraſmuch as the Soul, in Deſire, conſiders the Good but as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and takes no other care but to draw neer unto it: but in Hope, ſhe fancies it ſo neer, not ſeeing any difficulties which it cannot overcome, that ſhe almoſt thinks it as if it were preſent, (whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that Joy is greater in it then in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:) So that ſhe makes not therein thoſe ſallies and dartings ſhe doth in this, unleſs ſhe be by ſome other things forced to it. On the contrary, ſhe ſtops to receive the Good which ſeems to be produced and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards her. This truth diſcovers it 'ſelf in theſe ordinary phraſes in theſe Paſſions: For when we ſay that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is urgent, ardent, and violent; that it moves it ſelf towards Good; that Hope is fixt and aſſured; that it upholds thoſe
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:47499:175"/>who hope; that it expects the deſired things; we unawares manifeſt how the Soul darts her ſelf out in Deſire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains her ſelf in Hope. So that theſe two motions being oppoſite, it is impoſſible that they can be performed at the ſame time, and that thoſe two Paſſions ſhould be there together, but neceſſarily they muſt form themſelves the one after the other; as we ſaid it muſt happen in thoſe of which we have ſpoken in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſes.</p>
                        <p>Yet it is very true, that this is not always ſo, but that Hope mixeth it ſelf moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with Deſire, Boldneſs, and Anger; in all which, the Soul never fails to caſt forth her ſelf: for the ſtedfaſtneſs ſhe keeps in that, is not contrary to the dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of her ſelf which ſhe makes in this; the firſt being a motion of the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, and the other a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole thing. And as you ſee a body may keep it ſelf ſtiff in it ſelf, and move it ſelf from one place to another, you muſt conceive the ſame in the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and imagine that Hope remains ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whilſt thoſe other Paſſions tranſport it out of it ſelf. But, neither doth it then ſtop, as we have ſaid; the cauſe of theſe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:47499:176"/>ſallies being ſtronger then that of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; which, to ſpeak truth, is not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to Hope, but a pure accident which never meets with it but when it is quite alone.</p>
                        <p>Let us now obſerve what moves the Appetite to ſtiffen thus: for although it have the vertue to move it ſelf as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and that it bends it ſelf to reſiſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; yet, being a blinde power, it knows not the difficulties, and the Fancie muſt neceſſarily propoſe them to it; and conſequently, it muſt be that which gives it the firſt ſhake, and teacheth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which in this encounter it ought to employ. After it hath then diſcovered the difficulties which might traverſe its deſignes, and that it believes it may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, it commands the Appetite to ſtand upon its guard, and hold it ſelf firm, for to make reſiſtance. But whence comes the belief it hath to overcome them? From the good opinion it hath of its own ſtrength. Whence it is, that thoſe who have many friends, much wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, thoſe who have ſuffered no diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to whom all hath happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; thoſe who are young and luſty; in fine, all thoſe who think themſelves po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:47499:176"/>in the goods of the Body, of the Minde, and of Fortune, eaſily hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe they have ſtrength enough to oppoſe all obſtacles, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all difficulties which can happen.</p>
                        <p>This good opinion is ſo neceſſary for Hope, that it makes almoſt all its kindes and differences: as it is greater or leſs, it cauſeth the ſtrength or weakneſs, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or defect of that Paſſion: It is that which produceth Preſumption and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which renders Hopes either doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or certain, good or ill, which augments or enfeebles them. Indeed, <hi>Preſumption</hi> is nothing but an immoderate hope, which proceeds from a too-great opinion we have of our own ſtrength. <hi>Confidence</hi> is an aſſurance we have of an expected help: 'Tis like the faith we give to promiſes w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the things ſeem to make in theſe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for we ſay, The ſeaſon promiſeth us fruit, That we promiſe our ſelves ſuch and ſuch a ſucceſs from our courage, forces, and friends. Finally, Hopes are either doubtful or certain, great or little, good or ill, according as we conceive the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtrong or weak, or as we ſuppoſe them to be more or leſs eaſie to be overcome.</p>
                        <p>Yet I think ſome diſtinction were here
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47499:177"/>neceſſary: for the moſt certain hope is not always the greateſt; and it is likely it is the greater, the more the ſoul ſtiffens it ſelf, ſince it is the particular motion which forms this Paſſion. Now ſhe ſtiffens herſelf the more, the greater the difficulties are ſhe encounters: But when the hinderances are light, ſhe moves not her ſelf ſo careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; conſequently Hope is leſs, although it be more certain. Our common phraſe confounds theſe things: for we ſay that we have great, ſtrong, and good hopes, when we would ſpeak them aſſured; and that they are ſmall, ill, and weak, when they are doubtful. Yet for all this, we ought to obſerve the diſtinctions we have made: for it is evident, that there are hopes which are weak and ſmall, not becauſe they are uncertain, but becauſe the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is ſo ſure, and the difficulties ſo ſmall, that the Soul makes no motion at all for them. And truely we can never call theſe hopes ill, although vulgarly great and ſtrong ones are eſteemed good.</p>
                        <p>It may be demanded how there may be hopes which are certain, ſince the belief we have of the event of the things we hope for, is always doubtful. Certainly we muſt confeſs that the certainty which
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47499:177"/>is therein to be found, is not infallible and of neceſſity; it is onely likely, and moral; And we call thoſe certain and ſure hopes, which are the leſs doubtful, and in which there is the leaſt to be feared.</p>
                        <p>But what? it ſeems then as if Fear were always mixt with Hope, although they are two contrary Paſſions. It is true, there is always ſome cauſe of Fear, there being reaſon always to doubt. But it follows not that Fear therefore forms it ſelf and mingles it ſelf with Hope, although even the Soul were ſurpriſed therewith. The Paſſions riſe not always up in ſight of their objects, whether it be that there are ſtronger which reſtrain them, and ſtifle them at their birth; or whether the Minde conſiders not attentively enough the cauſes which ought to move it. In Hope, the Soul is more attentive to the Good, then to the difficulties which beſiege her: She looks upon them but by the way, and believes ſhe can overcome them. Even then alſo, what ſubject ſoever there be of Fear, without examination ſhe in effect fears it not. But if ſhe conſider the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties more then the good, and if ſhe take an opinion that ſhe is unable to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them; Hope gives place to Fear,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47499:178"/>which flees in its turn, out of other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations; cauſing a flood and ebbe, which is often ſo ſwift and rapid, that it ſeems as if theſe two Paſſions mixt and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves together. But we muſt review theſe things in the Diſcourſe of Fear. Let us now conſider what the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirits and of the Humours are in Hope.</p>

                        <head>PART 3. <hi>What the motion of the Spirits is in</hi> Hope.</head>
                        <p>SInce the Spirits move in the Paſſions conformable to the emotion of the Soul, they muſt, when ſhe ſtiffens and confirms her ſelf in her ſelf when ſhe hopes, in ſome manner ſuffer alſo the ſame agitation. All the difficulty then is, to know how it may be done: for it is not eaſie to conceive how thoſe fluid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til bodies can get a quality which belongs to thoſe onely which are groſs and ſolid. Neither muſt you believe they congeal here, as they ſay it happens in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; or that they fix, as thoſe Metalick ſpirits do whereof Chymiſtry relates ſuch miracles: for, beſides that thoſe we ſpeak of are much finer, and perhaps of another kinde then thoſe are, they muſt at that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:47499:179"/>time become immoveable, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, all the parts whereto they are to run, muſt remain without action, ſince they can work onely by their motion: Which yet cannot be true: Experience and Reaſon ſhew us, that the organs move freely in this Paſſion; and that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which often mixeth with it, as we have ſhewn, cauſeth the ſpirits to move, without ruining the ſetledneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence which Hope gives them. We might perhaps imagine that they contract and gather themſelves together, that, by uniting and crowding their parts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they become ſtiffer and ſtronger, and ſo put themſelves in poſture the better to reſiſt the aſſaults might be made againſt them. And certainly, there is a great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood that ſome ſuch thing is done in this encounter: For the Soul, which knows that what is united is ſtronger then what is divided, never fails ſo to fortifie it ſelf when ill appears. Now the difficulties which are always found in Hope, are taken for evils, becauſe they oppoſe themſelves to the poſſeſſion of good: And it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore likely that the Soul contracts the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the better to defend her ſelf from that enemy which croſſeth her deſigne.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47499:179"/>Yet as in this Paſſion ſhe is wont but by the way to conſider of thoſe difficulties which conſequently ſeem not ſo great, nor ſo uneaſie to be overcome; we muſt not doubt but that, if ſhe contract the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it is ſo little, that it is neither conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, or powerful to confirm them in the manner they ought to be.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, the Spirits cannot much contract themſelves without retiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and conſequently making the face look pale, foraſmuch as they draw the blood along with them, and rob the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the colour it had before. So that Hope having the property to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the countenance equal, and not to change its colour; if it renders them ſo firm as we have ſaid, it muſt be by ſome other means then by contracting or reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them together.</p>
                        <p>To conceive then how this is done, we muſt obſerve that the Soul can hope for nothing but what ſhe firſt loved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: it is neceſſary that the Spirits ſhould move conformably to theſe two Paſſions, before Hope can agitate them. Now they dilate and open themſelves in Love, to embrace the good; and in Deſire they commonly recoil a little, that they may
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47499:180"/>the more eaſily dart themſelves towards it. Being in this ſtate then, if Hope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, it changeth nothing in the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their parts, it retains them onely in the proportion they had together; and from free and wandering, as they were, they ſubject themſelves to a certain order which they keep amongſt themſelves as long as Hope laſts; which is made by the ſouls intermiſſion, which hath an abſolute command over them, placing them as ſhe will, ſtopping them as ſhe pleaſeth, and holding them as it were by the hand in the rank ſhe had placed them: And for that time, they remain firm and ſtable, without confounding themſelves with others, or inwardly retreating, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing outwardly; which is the particular motion of the ſpirits in this Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>Some perhaps will ſay, that if theſe parts remain firm and ſtable, they will not move, and conſequently, that the Spirits would have no motion in Hope. But there are things, which, although they do not change place, forbear not to move. Thus Elementary bodies which are not in their centre, although they are retained and ſeem immoveable, yet they make a kinde of an endeavour to return to their
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47499:180"/>natural place, which makes them ſeem either light or heavie. We may ſay the ſame of the Spirits, which being retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſtrange violence, are not truely at reſt, but ſuffer a ſecret agitation which holds them in continual ſuſpence.</p>
                        <p>Now although the Spirits remain thus firm and ſtable in Hope, it hinders not but that at the ſame time they may be agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by other Paſſions which mix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it. So Deſire and Boldneſs may caſt them forth without mixing their ſtedfaſtneſs, becauſe it conſiſts but in the order of their parts, which this darting forth deſtroys not, as we have ſaid, ſeeing we may move a thing from one place to another, without diſturbing the order and motion which thoſe parts may have amongſt themſelves.</p>
                        <p>It is alſo true, that as Deſire grows weak when Hope is ſtrong, if the Spirits are very ſtable, their darting forth cannot be ſo great, becauſe they are not ſo free, nor ſo eaſie to move as they would be were they not reſtrained: That if Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons riſe whoſe motion quite deſtroys that of Hope, as Joy and Deſpair; then we may be ſure that Hope ceaſeth for a time, to give place to thoſe others; and that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47499:181"/>the Spirits loſe their firmneſs, to diſperſe or ſlacken themſelves, afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming their firſt conſiſtence, if the Soul ſees new ſubjects of Hope; which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens ſo readiry, that it ſeems as if it were done in an inſtant, and that theſe motions confound themſelves the one with the other.</p>
                        <p>I ſee nothing more here to ſtop us, but that ſome may chance to imagine, that if it were true that in Hope the ſoul and the ſpirits did bend themſelves to reſiſt difficulties, ſomewhat muſt appear on the outward parts, and they alſo muſt bend themſelves for the ſame purpoſe; ſince that in Laughter we ſee the muſcles retire as the ſoul doth, that in Deſire and in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they caſt themſelves out as ſhe doth; that they ſlacken in Joy, and that all other Paſſions make the ſame impreſſion on the Body, as the Objects do in the Appetite. But we muſt conſider, that the organs of a voluntary motion move not in the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but through the ſtrength and efficacie of the object, which urgeth the ſoul, and obligeth it to employ all the means ſhe hath to attain the end ſhe propoſed her ſelf, as we ſee it happens in all violent Paſſions; or elſe out of a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47499:181"/>ſhe hath to ſhew outwardly what ſhe inwardly reſents, as ſhe doth in Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and in Careſſes. So that there being none of thoſe motives in Hope, ſhe needs move none of thoſe outward parts, and contents her ſelf with the agitation ſhe gives the ſpirits; not conſidering the ill but by the by, ſhe eſteems it not ſo great, as to employ all her endeavours againſt it: ſo that ſhe commonly agitates but the moſt mobile parts, as are the ſpirits, the eyes, the brows, and ſome other parts, as it happens in all other Paſſions which are weak or moderate.</p>

                        <p>BUt ſince we have ſpoken ſufficiently of the ſecret tempeſts, let us now ſee whence thoſe come which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear outwardly, and examine why Hope renders men bold, preſumptuous, teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, inſolent, credulous, negligent in their affairs, and impatient in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; although it be the moſt moderate and the calmeſt of all the Paſſions of the Minde.</p>
                        <p>It is eaſie to diſcover the cauſe of its <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> after having ſhewed how it moves the Soul and the Spirits: for it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſhould keep them ſtiff and ſtable as it doth, and that it ſhould be ſubject to thoſe agitations which are abſervable in other Paſſions: On the contrary, thoſe
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:47499:182"/>languiſhing and impetuous ones which mix with it, aſſume a conformable medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity to that kinde of motion which ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the ſoul between ardor and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as we have already ſaid; wherefore it enfeebles the Deſire when it is too ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſtirs it up when it is remiſs; it is a ſpur to Lazineſs, and a bridle to Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; it hinders Boldneſs from being raſh, and takes off the tranſports of Joy: and if it chance to be with Fear, and with Grief, it ſo moderates them, that they fail not of their courage, and refuſe not to admit of the ſweeteſt Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>But whence comes it then, that it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders men raſh, vain, and impatient? How can Anger and Fury be compatible with it? And if it excite and animate the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and the Deſires, how doth it beget Negligence and Idleneſs? And yet we cannot doubt but that in ſome ſort it is the cauſe of all theſe effects. But they alſo who will conſider the manner of their production, will confeſs, that it is neither the neareſt, nor even the true cauſe: For Hope indeed begets Boldneſs; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Boldneſs runs to Temerity: it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites and awakens the Deſires; but theſe bring Diſquiet and Impatience with them:
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47499:183"/>it brings Joy with it; but aftewards Joy flees into raptures and extaſies: it inſpires the Appetite with Revenge; which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards converted into Fury: Finally, it gives Confidence, and that begets Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, vanity, and the ſcorn of all things which may traverſe our deſignes; whence, after, Negligence and Lazineſs are bred. So that all theſe defects come not immediately from Hope, but from the other Paſſions which accompany it. And it is clear, that when theſe are raiſed to this exceſs, it quite vaniſheth, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes extremely weak: For when we are ſenſible of a great Joy, at that very moment we have no ſenſe of Hope: it ſcarce appears in violent Deſires, nor in the tranſports of Anger; the ſoul ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf to be born away by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motions of thoſe Paſſions: And Preſumption it ſelf, which ſeems nothing but an exceſs of Hope, wholly ruines it; imagining that there are no difficulties which can oppoſe its deſignes: for, where there is no more a difficulty, there remains no Hope.</p>
                        <p>However it be, <hi>Boldneſs</hi> is eaſily joyned with Hope, becauſe the Soul having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed her ſelf by this to the reſiſtance
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47499:183"/>of difficulties, is already in ſtate to aſſault them if they appear very ſtrong, and if ſhe betake her ſelf to conſider the danger wherein they may caſt her, for want of fighting and overcoming them: Beſides that the good opinion ſhe hath of her ſtrength, heightens her Courage, and perſwades her that it is not enough to maintain the defenſive part, but we muſt purſue and aſſault our enemy. If her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not proportionable to this good opinion, and that ſhe believes them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then in effect they are, thence ariſeth <hi>Preſumption;</hi> which, joyned with Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, reacheth to <hi>Temerity;</hi> and thence grows <hi>Inſolence:</hi> in the ſame manner as with Joy ſhe begets <hi>Vanity, Prattle,</hi> and <hi>Importunity,</hi> as in its place we ſhall further ſhew.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Impatience</hi> raigns powerfully in this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Foraſmuch as it commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Joy, Deſire, and Fear, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomewhat of theſe three mixt with Hope; and even they are often found all together. So that we muſt not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we are unquiet when we hope, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be from the apprehenſion we have that we ſhall not ſoon enough poſſeſs the good we expect, or from the urgency of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47499:184"/>preſſing deſires, or from the ſparkling which accompanies pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>There is no Paſſion ſo <hi>credulous</hi> as Hope: for others give credence onely to the Good or Ill propoſed, but this equally gives in Both. Indeed, pleaſing things one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade Joy, Love, and Deſire: thoſe which are troubleſome make no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them, without deſtroying them. On the contrary, Ill onely is reſented by Grief, Fear, and Deſpair; Good hath neither audience nor admittance among them. But Hope hearkens to both of them, foraſmuch as being in the midſt between both, it eaſily inclines towards thoſe extremities: and ſhe no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves what favours her deſignes, but ſhe hearkens to what renders them impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                        <p>The Corporal characters which are found in this Paſſion, are of two kindes, as in all the reſt: The one by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Soul, the others by Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The motions of the head, brows, eyes, and voice, and of all the body, are of the firſt rank: The reſt are in the form of ordinary effects.</p>
                        <p>The body ſets it ſelf upright, the head is lifted up, the brows are raiſed, for the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47499:184"/>ſame intention. For the Soul, which would obtain the good, and reſiſt the difficulties which oppoſe it, puts it ſelf in poſture to do both. Now beſides that this poſture is advantagious for to ſee afar off what may happen, it is ſo alſo in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of Good, or in defence of Ill, if one be aſſaulted by it; it is the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſituation which bodies require for action; it is the motion which begins all other actions of creatures; whether to purſue pleaſing things, or to flee or aſſault ill ones, the firſt thing they do is to lift up the head and the body. The Soul now putting her ſelf in poſture of defence, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth thus of thoſe organs, that ſhe may not be ſurpriſed; and raiſeth them, to make them the firmer; as in Deſpair, and in Fear, where ſhe ſlackens her ſelf, ſhe bows the body, hangs the head, and caſts down the eyes and brows.</p>
                        <p>An <hi>aſſured countenance</hi> is made by a wide opening of the eye-lids with vivacity. A fixt and ſtedfaſt look, it is common to Anger, Impudence, Boldneſs, and Hope; yet with this difference, that in Anger the eyes are too ardent; too open in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence; and too rude in Boldneſs. But in Hope they have none of theſe defaults;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47499:185"/>all is therein moderate; and it ſeems as if ſweetneſs and ſeverity were confounded together in all its motions. The eyes then are more open then ordinary, the better to ſee the good, and the difficulties which preſent themſelves. The ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs of the looks, is a ſigne that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments aſtoniſh not the Minde, and that it believes it ſhall overcome them. The vivacity of the eyes comes from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which Deſire hath driven to theſe parts, or which Joy hath there diſperſed. In fine, ſweetneſs and ſeverity are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mixt together, becauſe that at the ſame time the ſoul ſees the Good and the Ill, and is touched both with the one and the other, and is not ſo ſure to obtain what ſhe pretends to, but that ſhe ſtill hath cauſe to doubt of it.</p>
                        <p>This Paſſion often alſo makes a man <hi>turn up his eyes,</hi> for that having need of the help of others to acquire what he ſeeks, it caſts his eyes towards heaven, as to the fountain of all good things, and the common helper of all Nature; and hath recourſe to ſuperiour cauſes, being not always aſſured of the aſſiſtance it promiſed it ſelf from others.</p>
                        <p>But when the looks are <hi>urgent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,</hi>
                           <pb n="335" facs="tcp:47499:185"/>they are effects of Deſire and Fear, which mix with it; in the ſame manner as Joy often cauſeth its tranſports, ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and agitations.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, <hi>the voice and the ſpeech are firm,</hi> that is to ſay, ſtrong, without vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency or inequality, neither heightning nor talling, neither trembling nor preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated: For the Soul, which bends it ſelf to reſiſt difficulties, is in no condition to fear: but becauſe alſo ſhe will not aſſault them, ſhe makes no great endeavour. Wherefore, the voice falls not, becauſe there is no weakneſs in the Minde; it riſeth not alſo, there being no violence therein; neither is it trembling, being without fear; nor precipitate, being without impetuoſity: but ſtrong and equal, the air being beaten ſtrongly and equally by the Soul, which hath aſſured and confirmed her ſelf againſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>There remains now onely the Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Characters which follow the agitation of the Humours and of the Spirits. The firſt, and that which ſeems the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Hope, is, <hi>that the colour of the face changeth not;</hi> the reaſon whereof we touched at the beginning of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:47499:186"/>For the Spirits, which become ſtable, ſtop alſo the blood, and hinder it from retiring inwardly, or diſperſing it ſelf outwardly. So that if ſometimes we grow pale, it is an effect of Fear, as bluſhing is of Love, Deſire, Joy, and the reſt of the Paſſions which drive the blood into the outward parts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sighs</hi> follow Love and Deſire alſo. It is Fear that cools and makes us loſe <hi>Courage;</hi> it is Boldneſs heats and re-animates it. Finally, <hi>Diſquiet</hi> chiefly comes from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and from Fear, which are augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by tediouſneſs and delays, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the poſſeſſion of the deſired Good. But theſe Characters are ſtrangers to Hope, whoſe examen is not here to be made: Let us onely conſider thoſe which ſeem fit and natural to it.</p>
                        <p>It renders the <hi>Pulſe ſtedfast,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vehement: for the heart and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which confirm themſelves as well as the ſpirits, make the Pulſe appear ſomewhat harder then it was; and by the touch you may perceive a ſteadineſs which it had not before. But this is without vehemency, foraſmuch as the ſoul makes no great endeavour to aſſault, as we ſaid; and the heat is temperate,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:47499:186"/>which require a moderate and equal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is true, if Hope fall into ſome cold and weak nature, it cauſeth a higher and greater Pulſe then it had uſually, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Soul, which knows her weakneſs, and whoſe deſigne is to fortifie her ſelf, ſomewhat augments the heat, which hath afterwards need of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er refreſhment. But at that time the Pulſe is nothing quicker; the heat being not ſo increaſed, that the Soul had need to trouble her ſelf to temper the ardor it might cauſe; ſhe contents her ſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the heart and the arteries, to receive the greater quantity of air. For it is the order which Nature holds when heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, that firſt ſhe makes the Pulſe greater and higher; after, ſhe makes it quick; and, at laſt, renders it thick: imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting herein what ſhe makes beaſts do, who, to go to a place, begin to march with great paces; which, if urged, they double; and at laſt betake themſelves to run. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, what we ſaid of the Pulſe, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in reſpiration, excepting the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Senſe therein cannot be ſenſible of; although it be likely that the ſubſtance of the Lungs may therein harden, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith it happens in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:47499:187"/>Anger, becauſe it is almoſt impoſſible that the Spirits, which run thorow all the parts, ſhould not imprint the quality they have, in thoſe which are ſoft and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as the Lungs are.</p>
                        <p>In a word, Hope <hi>fortifies all the parts,</hi> becauſe the ſpirits therein are more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous: and as it ſtops, and in a manner retains them, that they cannot diſſipate, nor make any violent motion, it is not to be diſputed, that of all the Paſſions it is the moſt advantageous for Health, for Length of life, for Vertue it ſelf, which with ſo great a care ſeeks Moderation, which naturally is to be found with Hope. I ſay again, It is advantageous for the Length of life: for, what ſerves for a great Health, is not always good to render Life long: Active and vehement heat produceth ſtrong actions, but ſhortens our days, becauſe the Spirits eaſily diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, and ſuddenly conſume the natural moiſture. So that, to live long, heat ſhould be moderate, the ſpirits ought not to be violently agitated, nor alſo ſhould they be languiſhing. Now if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture give them not this juſtneſs, then it ſeems there is onely Hope which can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it us, being the onely one which
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:47499:187"/>retains it, and ſecures it, without ſuffering exceſſive heat, or irregular motion. And therefore we muſt not wonder, if thoſe who feed themſelves with good hopes, live longer then other Men: And if death often follows high ſucceſſes, it is becauſe it makes us loſe Hope, which is the true Anchor which holds faſt our Soul, our Lives, and our Yeers.</p>

But none flies higher then <hi>Mounſieur de Balſac,</hi> who tells Mr. <hi>Chapelin</hi> in two of his Letters to him; in the one, What great matters he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from the learning and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Our Author; and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother he breaks forth into theſe expreſsions, Wiſhing his Book had been far greater, that his pleaſure might have been the more laſting; that he never read any thing with

                        <p>In effect, ſo turbulent and ſo factious a ſtate as that of the Paſſions, ought not to be governed by one that is blind or effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, who is born to ſerve, and which would ceaſe to be what ſhe is, did ſhe but ceaſe to command. Boldneſs were the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be imployed, which is a noble and generous Paſſion, which is the Mother of Valor, and the onely one which can fight, which can overcome, which can triumph.</p>
                        <p>It's ſhe who hath eſtabliſhed all the Powers and all the Empires of the World, who hath made all the great Princes, and all the Hero's, who firſt opened the way to glory and immortality, and who onely lawfully diſpenſeth Victories; For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Fortune vaunts to be the Miſtris of them, to give them when and to whom ſhe pleaſeth, they become ſhameful, if Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes them not meritorious: And thoſe who conquer without her, yield to the conquered the honor of the combate, and leave them the faireſt part of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, it's ſhe inſpires Vertue with that noble ardor which makes her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the high &amp; moſt difficult things, which lends her arms to combate Vice, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords her ſtrength to quell the Paſſions, and which after ſhe hath made her triumph

For we muſt not beleeve that the moſt noble imployments of Boldneſs are to gain Battels, to take Towns, and to conquer Kingdoms: Nature thinks not of theſe diſorders, when ſhe ſows the ſeeds of this Paſſion in the Soul. She minds more important Combates and Conqueſts which are far more uſeful, and much more glorious.</p>
                        <p>Knowing that Man is deſtined for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, that there are a thouſand kindes of Enemies which defend his entry, and that himſelf moſt commonly oppoſeth himſelf moſt of all, againſt his own good; She gives him Boldneſs, as a neceſſary ſuccor to overcome obſtacles, and to enter into the enjoyment of thoſe goods for which they conteſted him.</p>
                        <p>So that we may ſay without her, he would be expoſed to the violence of all both within and without himſelf; That his life would be but a continual ſence of fear and of deſpair. In a word, that he were the moſt impotent and moſt unhappy of all creatures. For although he boaſts to have a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47499:193"/>more perfect compoſition of body, clearer knowledges, more noble Appetites then all other Animals: And that he is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that corruption which deſtroys all other things; yet when we have well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined theſe advantages, they would be uſeleſs to him, yea they would be perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious if he were without Boldneſs; ſince the perfect temper which he hath, renders him weak and delicate, that his Reaſon is naturally timerous and ſuſpitious, that his Paſſions are baſe and effeminate, and that immortality without a good iſſue is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif without end, and without meaſure: So that Boldneſs bereaving him of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fear, raiſing him to generous actions, and conducting him to Felicity, we cannot doubt but it's ſhe who corrects the defects of our birth, which makes it enjoy prerogatives which ſhe affords it, and to which it ows all its nobility, all its excellency, and all its good fortune.</p>
                        <p>But as this Paſſion follows the deſtiny of the moſt perfect things, whoſe diſorders are always the greateſt, and their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the moſt dangerous: So it happeneth alſo, that when ſhe paſſeth the bounds ſhe ought to keep, none cauſeth greater diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor is more an Enemy to Man, and to Civil Society.</p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47499:193"/>
                        <p>It's from her that Vice, which of it ſelf is timerous, and loves to hide it ſelf, takes heart and ſtrength, becomes inſolent and proud, that it ſhews it ſelf braſen-fac'd, and appears in publick: All thoſe deteſtable crimes which have ruined ſo many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ſo many Republicks, had never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the thoughts of thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, or at leaſt would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in them without effect, had not Boldneſs been a Complice of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>No, without her there had never been ſeditious perſons, nor Rebells; Uſurpers, nor Tyrants; Parricides, nor committers of Sacriledge; without her we had never ſeen ſo many Armies defeated, ſo many Provinces deſolate, ſo many People ruined, ſo many Empires deſtroyed without her. In fine, Pride and Ambition which are the ſources of all our miſchiefs, and of all publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, had been unknown or impotent Paſſions; And if we may ſo ſpeak, perhaps Peace and Juſtice had never retired out of the World, had Boldneſs never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</p>
                        <p>So that if we rightly conſider the goods and the ills ſhe brings, ſhe may fitly be compared to the heat which the Sun defuſeth on the Univerſe; for like it ſhe heats and ſtirs up
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47499:194"/>all languiſhing Vertues, ſhe inſpires ſtrength and vigor into all the world, ſhe cauſeth the nobleſt effects which are to be found therein, and if ſhe produceth not gold and precious ſtones, yet we may ſay ſhe makes Scepters and Crowns.</p>
                        <p>But like the ſame heat alſo ſhe commonly corrupts all the beſt of things; ſhe brings forth monſters and prodigies, ſhe forms thunders and tempeſts; and there are whole Climates which ſhe hath turned into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts and Solitudes. Even ſhe ſo much the more reſembles it, that as that quality makes uſe of the light to produce its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous effects, this Paſſion alſo makes uſe of glory to execute its evil deſigns. At leaſt ſhe fancies to her ſelf that honor is ſtill to be acquired in all thoſe undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and although they are criminal or unhappy, yet ſhe imagins, that the ſhame to have committed a crime, or to have had an ill ſucceſs, is far ſhort of the glory to have dared much.</p>
                        <p>But neither is this a place to defend or condemn her; we muſt onely therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe her, and according to our propoſed order, make thoſe Characters appear which ſhe imprints in the Soul and Body of thoſe who are ſenſible of her.</p>
                        <p>To deſign the picture of Boldneſs, a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47499:194"/>man had need of the Art and Penſil of thoſe great Painters,
<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Bold Man.</note> who repreſented one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods and Hero's; for it's a Paſſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together heroick, and which at all times hath been placed in the rank of Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſms, and of divine Furies. In effect, when it enters the Soul it fills it with ſo much ſplendor and majeſty, it inſpires ſuch noble ſentiments, and gives it ſuch wonderful motions and tranſports, that it ſeems as if it were for us to wrong it, to ſeek its birth here below, and that with reaſon we may beleeve that Nature is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oo weak to produce a thing that is ſo excellent.</p>
                        <p>But whether it be a preſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or no, it is certain it is the greateſt and moſt advantagious that the Soul could ever hope for: It compleats all its glory and all its riches; and if it be true that the Sun hath Houſes, where he is ſenſible that his power and forces increaſe, we may ſay that Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Throne where the Soul findes its greatneſs and its elevation, where ſhe placeth her ſelf above all thoſe Powers which aſſault her, and where ſhe deſpiſeth all thoſe dangers wherewith ſhe may be threatned.</p>
                        <p>And to ſpeak truth, it's matter of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to ſee that a man ſhould have none at the ſight of precipices, ſhipwracks
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47499:195"/>and of all the moſt frightful things in the world; Danger environs him on all ſides, his Enemies preſs him on all parts, Death preſents it ſelf to him in a thouſand places, and in a thouſand manners; all theſe things aſtoniſh him not; nay, he often takes them for illuſions, and laughs at them as vain fantaſms, which in his opinion are fit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to terrifie timerous minds. But if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to find reſiſtance, and that he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be an honor to combate or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them; then his Courage ſwels, his Vigor awakes, his whole Soul ſeems to increaſe with his Forces, and as if in effect ſhe were grown greater, he entertains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only with great thoughts, he forms none but great deſigns, and ſuffers himſelf to be moved with none but by the moſt noble and moſt generous of the Paſſions; For his ſpirit is ſilled with nothing but the glory and the immortality which he intends to acquire. He imagins that all the World makes ready Crowns for him alone to deſerve, and as if the approach of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did haſten him the Victory, he ſees him with pleaſure, he accoſts him with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and beleeves that the beginning of the Combate is but the commencement of his riumph.</p>
                        <p>You muſt not at that time think of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47499:195"/>him; the advice you give will be cowardly counſel, the ill omens which you obſerve will be ſuperſtitions or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. In fine, all the cares we take to withdraw him from the danger wherein he is going to caſt himſelf, are injurious to him, and thoſe that take them are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed timerous Souls, or Enemies of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                        <p>The forbiddings of a Father, the tears of a Family, nor the reverence of the Laws are not able to ſtop him; he tramples all manner of reſpects under his feet, and like a torrent which is irritated by obſtacles, which throws down Dams, and becomes more rapid by reſiſtance, it adds fury to his paſſion, he makes way with force; and what is oppoſed againſt him ſerves but to make him with the more impetuoſity run to the place of combate. He will not there ſpend his time in unprofitable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; he ſpeaks, but at the ſame time he ſtrikes, and his words rather ſerve to expreſs his Courage then his thought; for he imploys them not in injuries, nor in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, nor in clearing himſelf, nor in vain threats; they are but interfering words and ſhort exclamations, which his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port wherein he is, draws from the mouth; they are as if they were the boylings of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47499:196"/>that ardor which agitates him within, or to ſay better, they are like the claps of thunder which come pouring down on his Enemy.</p>
                        <p>And truly it can be better compared to nothing then Thunder; like that, at the ſame time it cauſeth the lightning, the noiſe, and the blow; like that, at the ſame time it ſtrikes, it pierceth, it caſts down all that reſiſts it; and if it be true that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to touch dead Bodies, and ſpares thoſe which ſleep, it's ſtill the more like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; never aſſaulting thoſe who have loſt heart, or are not in a condition able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves. For although in the heat of the Battel he ſeems onely to breath cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and that his fury ought not to be glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ought but blood and ſlaughter, yet it's very certain that none make uſe of Victory more moderately: He never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to inſolency, and we may ſay he at the ſame time diſarms his Paſſion when he diſarms his Enemy; As ſoon as he ſees him on the ground he raiſeth him up, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth him, and not remembring the blows he received, he complains onely of thoſe which he hath given; he ſpeaks mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly of the advantage he had over him, and how great ſoever a lover of glory he is, he yeelds to the chance of Arms, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47499:196"/>greateſt part of what he hath acquired. It is not that in his Soul he beleeves not but that his Valor made his Fortune good, but that he ardently ſeeks the praiſes and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors which Victory hath made him merit, and but that he eſteems all thoſe ſtupid or envious who admire not the wonders which he thinks he hath done: But it's the nature of the Paſſion which moves him to flye unto glory, by ſuch noble and civil ways, and to cover his ambition by free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous proceedings and by a modeſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe or ſilence: In a word, his freeneſs is ambitious, his generoſity is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and his modeſty is proud.</p>
                        <p>And in effect, there are a thouſand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters wherein he loſeth his diſcretion, and cannot hide that high and imperious humor which accompanies him. For if he hath any deſign in hand, he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be cheif of the Councel, and of the enterpriſe; He beleeves and ſpeaks high, that he is the onely man, who knows the means to make it ſucceed, and it's he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can execute it. And as if Prudence and good Fortune could do nothing without him, he confidently aſſures that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs cannot but be unhappy unleſs he hath the conduct of it, or at leaſt if he be not of the party.</p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:47499:197"/>
                        <p>In the mean time, it's certain that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there is no man leſs capable to give or to follow good counſel then he; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption makes him deſpiſe the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, precipitation bereaves him of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and the great confidence which he hath in himſelf, expoſeth him to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dangers, and makes him fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the ambuſhes which are prepared for him.</p>
                        <p>It's true, that he periſheth nobly in them, and that the proofs which he gives of his Courage, may wipe away the ſhame of his temerity or of his imprudence; for although he be ſurpriſed by his Enemy, that he ſees very well that reſiſtance is uſeleſs, and that all what preſents it ſelf before his eyes declare his loſs; yet all this makes him not loſe Courage nor Judgement, after having without trouble, and without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, conſidered the greatneſs of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a certain generous choler and a noble deſpair ſeizeth on him, which tranſports him beyond himſelf, and carries him through fire and ſword, and makes him perform ſuch wonderful efforts, that they ſeem to ſurpaſs his natural ſtrength. He ſtrikes, he caſts down, he kills all thoſe whom his ſword can reach; and after a long fight finding himſelf rather caſt down
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47499:197"/>then conquered, he leaves a ſad Victory to the Victor, and an ample cauſe of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and of jealouſie.</p>
                        <p>But we labor in vain in one picture to repreſent all the motions which this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can form in the Soul; they are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent amongſt themſelves, that its impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould be found in one and the ſame ſubject. And we may ſay that Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a fire which produceth as many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of heat and flame, as it is taking in ſeveral matters. There is no inclination nor profeſſion which hath not its own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and although this Paſſion be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally generous and modeſt, and be far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from choler or cruelty, and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with fear or aſtoniſhment; yet ſome are found to be baſe and inſolent, ſome which are Bragadocio's, brutal and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Choler almoſt always accompanies that of Women and Children; and many of thoſe who boldly run into danger loſe their courage as ſoon as it preſents it ſelf before them. But that which is moſt ſtrange is, Fear often devanceth the moſt noble Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; thoſe often who are moſt valiant in fight, dare not ſpeak in publick; and as the moſt furious Beaſts are frighted at the ſight of Spectra's, and of the feebleſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Beaſts there are ſome who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47499:198"/>cauſe are afraid at the firſt encounter of ſome perſons, who cannot endure the preſence of ſome things, and even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror cannot ſo much as walk in the dark: We will here examine the cauſe of theſe differences. We will now therefore ſee whether Boldneſs hath as much power over the body, as in hath over the ſoul, and whether ſhe can imprint out wardly as fair characters as thoſe which ſhe forms within.</p>
                        <p>Certainly we muſt confeſs that no Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives ſo advantagious a Mind, nor ſo noble and becoming a port to a man as this doth; all others corrupt that maſculine beauty which he naturally ought to have; ſome render him fierce and ſavage, as Anger and Deſpair, others make him ſoft and effeminate, as Love and Joy; Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs onely gives him that majeſtical air, that graceful ſtatelineſs, and that bold pride, which becomes his Nature and his Sex.</p>
                        <p>In effect, can we behold any thing more auguſt, more full of pompe, then a man whom Boldneſs leads into danger? That generous coldneſs which appears in his face, that ſetled look, his proud march, and the noble efforts which he makes in fight, inſpire in the mind I cannot tell
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47499:198"/>what kind of veneration, and in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, make the moſt magnifick repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vertue which can be imagined. For it is not only in the progreſs of this Paſſion that it takes this heroick air; it forms it ſelf from the firſt motions it makes in the heart, and he no ſooner perceives the danger, but we may ſee in his eyes the reſolution which he takes, and the confidence he hath to overcome it.</p>
                        <p>He coldly conſiders it, without emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without changing colour; and if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he trembles, and grows pale at the encounter thereof, we may beleeve it is not that he fears it, but it's the greatneſs of his own Courage which aſtoniſheth him. Neither doth this trouble laſt long; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently recompoſeth and reaſſureth himſelf, and looking through and through his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with a ſevere ſmile, he makes us judge that he at once both ſcorns and threatens him.</p>
                        <p>If he thinks he ought to aſſault him, he marcheth towards him with large paces, but gravely, with an erect and ſtable ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with his brow lifted up, and his ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eyes ſeem as if they would go out of their place, and begin the Combate before they come to handy blows. For without winking, and without heeding any thing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47499:199"/>elſe, he keeps them always fixed on him; he conſiders his port, his pace, his arms; he meaſures him, and ſeems to ſeek afar off thoſe places which are weakeſt, and marks thoſe which are to receive his firſt blows. Afterwards he accoſts him with a ſilence both fierce and diſdainful, with his forehead ſhriveled up betwixt his brows, ſtooping his head, and all his body bowed and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it ſelf; he aſſaulteth him, he thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, he preſſeth him; and calling to his ſuccor that noble fury which reigns in Combates, he ſuffers himſelf to be carried away by it, and at laſt abandons himſelf to all the turbulency and impetuoſity whereof it is capable.</p>
                        <p>Then it is that fire flies up into his face, that his looks become terrible, and that all his air, his port, and his mind render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves formidable. His hairs ſtand on end, his Forehead wrinkles, his Noſtrils widen, and all his veins are ſwoln and extended. Sometimes he blows with impetuoſity; ſometimes he keeps in his breath, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lips and his Teeth, he diſplaies his Arms, and diſchargeth his greateſt and moſt heavy blows; Sometimes he ſighs under the endeavors he makes, and from time to time he ſends forth the ſhort and penetrating lightnings of his Voyce where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47499:199"/>it ſeems he would provoke his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and ſtartle his Enemy. He ſtamps the ground with his Feet, he puts forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he leaps, he bows himſelf; and the ſweat running from all the parts of him mixeth it ſelf with the blood and duſt wherewith he is covered, and forms I know not what frightful colour which renders him ſtill the more formidable, whilſt his Breſt all red and inflamed, raiſeth up it ſelf with grievous ſecourſes, and cauſeth a ſtrong and fond reſpiration; his heart beats with violence, and did you feel his Pulſe, you would eaſily judge by the greatneſs, ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vehemency of it, that the Soul hath none of its powers which are not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this Paſſion. But let us finiſh his Picture with this Combate, neither is there ought elſe to be deſcribed therein, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Victory or his Loſs, which can add nothing to the Characters of Boldneſs, but thoſe of Joy or of Grief. Let us therefore ſeek the cauſes of all theſe effects in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Paſſion.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THe Soul propoſeth not more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in forming Boldneſs,
<note place="margin">The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that is in defining of Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> then the Minde encounters for attaining the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. It muſt combate monſters, and aſſault whole Armies to acquire this knowledge; and at a leſs rate then to be of its party; it's impoſſible to reſiſt ſo many opinions, and ſo many errors which have hid or corrupted its Nature. In effect, there is none of the Paſſions which hath more divided mens minds, which hath been more diverſly defined, and of which more ſtrange and more different pictures have been made. For there have been ſome ſo extravagant that they would not have placed it in the rank of Paſſions; beleeving, that to be bold was nothing but to deſpiſe danger, or not at all to fear it. And that Scorn being an effect of Judgment, and want of Fear, a privation, neither of them could be a motion of the Appetite; but who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a man that aſſaults his Enemy, ſcorns him? Contrariwiſe, if he ſcorned him, he would not aſſault him, ſince we never aſſault but thoſe things which may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47499:200"/>hurt us, and we deſpiſe thoſe onely which can do neither good nor hurt. And again, who will beleeve, that not to fear is to be bold, ſince ſtupidity and ſleep take away fear without making us bold. Others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be onely a powerful deſire to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and overcome what is hurtful; but ſince we do not deſire to aſſault any more, when we have once effectually done it; in ſuch an encounter Boldneſs muſt ceaſe to be, ſince then even the deſire ceaſeth; yet it's certain, that Boldneſs continues and augments its ſelf even in fight.</p>
                        <p>Others will have it nothing but a great and a ſtrong Hope; but beſides that, there are great hopes often found without any Boldneſs; what would you ſay of a Slave whoſe Maſters goodneſs hath given him a very great and moſt aſſured hope of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, would he then have a very great Boldneſs? To what purpoſe ſhould he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his Courage? muſt it be to combate his good fortune, or to aſſault his ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill hap?</p>
                        <p>There are others which call it a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Courage, which makes a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf power enough to overcome the miſchiefs which threatens him, that he without aſtoniſhment ſees them come, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he frighted when they are come;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47499:201"/>But beſides that reſolution is an effect of judgment, and not of the Appetite, and that often without being bold we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed at the danger becauſe we know it not; All the utmoſt endeavor of this Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeems to be imployed to bear misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues without daring to aſſault them; and yet this is the moſt noble, and perhaps the onely imployment it can have.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this, they will have, that one of the Paſſions of the Soul muſt fortifie it, and render it aſſured againſt all thoſe ills which are to be ſhunned with moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and encourage it to purſue thoſe goods which are acquired with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pains: But force and aſſurance belong not to the Appetite, and inſtead of being the effects of Boldneſs, they are rather the cauſes of it; for the Soul muſt feel it ſelf ſtrong and aſſured before ſhe engage herſelf in Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>To ſay alſo with the Schools, that it is a motion which the Appetite makes to obtain a good which is to be acquired with difficultie; it's to be ignorant of the true object of Boldneſs, which obligeth it ſelf to peril and danger. It is to confound it with Hope and with Anger, even alſo with Fear, which according to their Maxims, are alſo motions of the Soul to obtain a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult good.</p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47499:201"/>
                        <p>To conclude, what definition ſoever may be given, if it expreſs not the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion which the Appetite ſuffers in this Paſſion, it doth diſguiſe it, inſtead of making it known; and rather preſents us with the ſhadow and fantaſm of Boldneſs, then ſhews what it truly is. Let's therefore endeavor to diſcover it, and without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obſerve the ill ways, let's conduct the Reader into that which is the beſt and moſt aſſured.</p>
                        <p>To this purpoſe we muſt ſuppoſe a thing known to all the World,
<note place="margin">That Ill is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Boldneſs?</note> That true Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſtirred up at the ſight of danger; that Combates, Shipwracks, Precipices, and death it ſelf, are the moſt worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which imploy it. In ſhort that ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt where the difficulties are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and where ſhe thinks to finde moſt reſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>Now as we ſaid in the diſcourſe of Hope, the difficulties and the ills appear unto the Soul either greater or leſſer then her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; if they are greater, ſhe flies them; if leſs, ſhe ſcorns or elſe ſhe aſſaults them. And truly the Schools ſay not enough when they eſtabliſh it for a Maxime, That the Soul hath but two ſorts of motions, the one by which ſhe purſues good, and the other whereby ſhe flies ill; for ſhe is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47499:202"/>not in a worſe condition then other things of Nature, which have not onely an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſeek what is fit for them, and flye what is hurtful, but they alſo have that to deſtroy what is contrary unto them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, it's certain that the Soul flies not all kinds of ill, that there are ſome which it aſſaults; and that if there be any Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it employs to execute ſo noble a deſign, it ought to be Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe that when an aſſault or a combate is to be made,
<note place="margin">That the Ill muſt be preſent.</note> the ill muſt needs be preſent, otherwiſe the endeavor which were to be made would be vain and uſeleſs: It thence follows, that the difficulties and dangers ought to be preſent, which ſtir up this Boldneſs; for if we conſider them as abſent, they may then perhaps oblige the Soul to prepare it ſelf, and to put it ſelf in a condition to reſiſt it, when it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf. But they cannot draw from her any endeavor to aſſault them; for as much as the preſence of the Enemy is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary when we ought to fight; then indeed it may be an Aſſurance, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, a Reſolution of Courage, but not a Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>In effect, the order which the Soul ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to form this Paſſion, is to conſider the evil to come, and to compare its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47499:202"/>with her own, and then having found hers great enough to ſurmount them, ſhe forms a deſire of fighting, and a hope of Victory; and at the ſame time ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares herſelf for the aſſault by the aſſurance and certainty which ſhe takes of the ſucceſs of her undertaking, by the reſolution ſhe makes to employ all thoſe Faculties which ought to obey her, and by the command which ſhe gives them to prepare themſelves for the Combate; then the Appetite obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her orders, ſtrengthens it ſelf, ſtiffening and ſettling it ſelf in it ſelf, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may not ſurpriſe it, and that it may be in a condition to reſiſt it, if it happen it ſhould preſent it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Yet hitherto there hath been no Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there are onely the diſpoſitions which go before her. For even then when the ill ſuffers it ſelf not to be foreſeen, and that it preſents it ſelf all on a ſudden, theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt ſtill precede the aſſault which ſhe ought to make, and there muſt be ſome moments which give the Soul time to make all thoſe preparatives which are neceſſary for her; otherwiſe in this encounter ſhe would endure no other Paſſion but that of Aſtoniſhment, of Fear, or of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
                        <p>In a word, all what precedes the aſſault
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47499:203"/>which the Appetite makes,
<note place="margin">Objections which ſhew that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ill may raiſe Boldneſs.</note> is not Boldneſs, no more then the preparatives for War are the Battel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And truly, as the preſence of good raiſeth in the mind different motions from thoſe which its abſence produceth therein; the preſence of ill muſt alſo cauſe other Paſſions then its abſence cauſeth: Now ſo it is that ſhe aſſaults the preſent ill, and that there no Paſſion employed for that effect but Boldneſs; And therefore all thoſe which ſhe forms in abſence of the ill, and which ſhe raiſeth before ſhe combat it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not the name of Boldneſs, or at leaſt the ſame name muſt be given to Paſſions which are altogether different: I know that ſome will ſay, that we are often ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the motion and of the effects of Boldneſs, although the Enemy appear not; That Anger which is never without her, is ſometimes raiſed againſt thoſe that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; That Hope always accompanies it, which reſpects onely the future: In fine, that our common way of ſpeaking affords not onely the name of Bold to him who affronts danger, but even to him who propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf to combate it, even to him who hath already fought it. So that there is no likelihood to reſtrain Boldneſs to nothing but the aſſault, nor to require the preſence of the ill as a neceſſary condition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47499:203"/>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> But all theſe Reaſons do not deſtroy the truth which we have eſtabliſhed;
for it's certain, that when Boldneſs and Anger riſe in the abſence of ill, the Imagination fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies it to it ſelf as preſent; that ſtrong and lively apprehenſion ſhe hath found thereof having bereaved it of the remembrance of its abſence. Neither is this difficult to conceive if we do but conſider the manner with which ſhe works, which makes her ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily fall into this error; foraſmuch as not ſeeing the things but by their Images, which being preſent with it, ought alſo always to repreſent the things as preſent unto it; did ſhe not make reflexion on their abſence, which is but a ſtranger and exterior condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body of the image, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no party of the principal figure, the Imagination cannot be never ſo little diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but ſhe muſt loſe the remembrance thereof, if Sence and Reaſon call it not back and ſtop it not, that they may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; whence it happens that in Sleep and in all the ſtrong Paſſions, wherein their guids are wont to abandon it, all the things which ſhe imagineth ſeem unto her as if ſhe ſaw them, and communicating its error to the Appetite, ſhe cauſeth it to make the ſame motions for them, as if they were truly preſent. When therefore the ills ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47499:204"/>not, and that Boldneſs and Anger forbear not to riſe in the Soul; yet for that are they not abſent from her, ſeeing they are preſent to her thoughts, and of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity we muſt beleeve, that to raiſe ſuch kind of Paſſions that ſhe fancies to her ſelf, that her Enemies are at hand, that they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on her, and that ſhe is going to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by them,
unleſs ſhe aſſault them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> As for Hope, its true, that Boldneſs is never without it; that a bold man always hopes, and that ſtill there is ſome good to come which ſeems to be the motive of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings: But from thence it follows not that the preſent ill ſhould not be the true object of Boldneſs, or that he is obliged to do ought elſe but to aſſault and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate it.</p>
                        <p>For there is a great deal of difference in ſaying, That Hope always keeps company with Boldneſs, and in ſaying, That Hope and Boldneſs have one and the ſame object, one end, and one employment; they both of them ſerve as well as the reſt of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to attain the end which the Soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it ſelf; but its an end which is ſtrange to them, and concerns them not; every one hath his own proper and peculiar one, which it at firſt encounters, and whereto it naturally tends, without taking care for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47499:204"/>the general which concerns the Soul; they properly are Souldiers which march and fight without knowing the deſign of the Head which conducts them. But to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, we muſt obſerve, that the end of actions is that which terminates them, and that they are terminated by their effects. Now there are effects which are near hand, and which are produced firſt, and others which are made in purſuit of them, and which for the ſame reaſon are farther off. In the actions alſo there is an end which is near, and another which is farther off; that is uniform and changeth not; the other is ſeveral and inconſtant, according to the divers uſe whereto the principal cauſe hath deſtinated it. So the firſt effect and the neareſt and natural end of Heat, is to warm; the reſt which follow for example, are to roſt or to burn, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Deſign which Nature or Art propoſe.</p>
                        <p>As the Paſſions therefore are actions and motions of the Appetite, they have alſo two kinds of End, the one which is near, and which is nothing but the firſt effect which is produced by them; ſo Union is the proper and true end of Love; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the Good is that of Deſire; the Enjoyment is that of Joy; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47499:205"/>is that of Boldneſs, and ſo of the reſt. All thoſe other ends which follow this firſt belong not at all to the Paſſion, but onely to the principal cauſe which is the Soul, which deſtines it to what uſe it pleaſeth her. So that the Combate being the firſt effect of Boldneſs, is alſo the only and true end: And if there be any good which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards expects, it is not ſhe that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, but Hope, or rather the Soul, which ſtirs up the moſt generous Paſſions to ſight with thoſe difficulties which hinder her the poſſeſſion thereof.</p>
                        <p>The preſent Ill is then the onely object of Boldneſs;
<note place="margin">What the end of Boldneſs is.</note> the Combate is the only End ſhe tends to; and if that afterwards ſerves to obtain ſome good, 'tis a ſucceſs which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens unknown to it, and which ſhe did not at all propoſe herſelf; otherwiſe we muſt ſay, that Hatred and Fear, and the reſt of the Paſſions which flye from ill, have good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for their object, ſince we flie not from ill but for ſome good which may thereby accrew.</p>
                        <p>But if any man ask what good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the Soul may make by this Combate, in a word, what the principal motive is which engageth her to aſſault ill: There is no man but will readily anſwer, That its to overcome it. But this is not to give a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47499:205"/>full Anſwer to the Queſtion; we would know what ſhe pretends to by this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for it is not ſufficient to ſay that it's to defeat or chaſe away an enemy, that it's to have preheminence over him, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the glory to have overcome him: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as theſe latter motions touch not the Senſitive Appetite, and that the other two leave the difficulty intire: Since we may further demand, why the Soul would defeat or drive away an Enemy? and what ever we ſhould ſay, that it were to flie from ill: beſides that this Reaſon is too looſe and too general, and befits all the angry Paſſions; It's certain, that in flying ſhe eſtrangeth herſelf from it in another manner then when ſhe drives it away; ſo that we muſt enquire the particular which in this encounter ſhe propoſeth herſelf: Now he that will conſider that the Soul ſtirs up for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Boldneſs, and that ſhe imploys them only when ſhe thinks that her enemy makes uſe of her own to ruine her; it's to be beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe hath no other deſign in aſſaulting it, but to take away from it the power and ſtrength of ill-doing: For which cauſe we are not ſatisfied to ſee our Enemies flie, but we purſue them, that making them loſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their life or liberty, we may bereave them of all their wreacking power. But we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47499:206"/>ſhall inſiſt upon this matter in the Chapter of Conſtancy.</p>
                        <p>After which,
<note place="margin">What the Nature of Boldneſs is.</note> we believe we ſhall have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied all the propoſed difficulties; for as to what concerns the common manner of ſpeaking, which gives the title of Bold to him who is no longer in danger, it's ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſay that we ſpeak not here of Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as of a Habit which keeps its name, even when it acts not, but as of a Paſſion, which is altogether in motion, and out of which it no longer is the Paſſion of Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>Let's then conclude, that Boldneſs is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the motion which the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite makes in aſſaulting ill. But how doth it aſſault it? It can be by no other way but by that whereby all things uſe to aſſault their Enemies; for as they fortifie themſelves, raiſe themſelves up, and throw themſelves on them; the Appetite doth the ſame, ſtiffens and faſtens it ſelf in it ſelf, it animates, it lifts it ſelf up, and ſhoots out it ſelf againſt ill. In effect, either we muſt not fancy motions in the Soul, nor qualifie the Paſſions with the name of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or of neceſſity we muſt confeſs that that of Boldneſs is ſuch as we have ſaid it to be. It's ſo natural, and ſo conformable to Reaſon, that we cannot'aſſure that the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47499:206"/>Soul purſues good, and that ſhe runs after it, that ſhe eſtrangeth her ſelf from ill and flies it, but we muſt be forced to confeſs, that ſeeing ſhe ought to combate it, ſhe is alſo obliged to raiſe up, and throw her ſelf againſt it.</p>
                        <p>And did not Reaſon perſwade this, let's but conſider the motions of the Body, which provokes it, with which hers muſt neceſſarily have a correſpondence; for it's impoſſible to ſee the putting forward of the Head, the ſtartings out of the Eyes, the elevation of the Muſcles, the motions of the Arms, the precipitate courſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous fallies which all the parts perform in this Paſſion, but we muſt preſently fancy, that it's the Soul which raiſeth up it ſelf, that throws it ſelf abroad, and even goes out of it ſelf, to joyn and fight againſt her Enemy, ſo that we cannot err in ſaying, <hi>That Boldneſs is a motion of the Appetite, by which the Soul throws it ſelf forth againſt ill, to combate it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For this ſhooting forth is the different motion which diſtinguiſheth it from all the reſt of the Paſſions in which the Soul ſhoots not herſelf forth, as in that of Love and of Hatred, of Joy and of Grief, of Hope and of Deſpair; and the motive of this ſpringing forth, which is to aſſault ill,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47499:207"/>and to combate it, renders it different from Deſire and Averſion, from Fear and from Anger; foraſmuch as if the Soul caſt it ſelf forth in Averſion or in Fear, its to eſtrange it ſelf from ill, and not to aſſault it: In Deſire it's to approach the Good, and in Anger it's to revenge it ſelf, as in its place ſhall be declared.</p>
                        <p>It's true this definition is very different from that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gave us in his Rhetorick, where he ſays, <hi>That Boldneſs is nothing elſe but a Hope which comes from the opinion which we have that expected Goods are near, and that things, which we fear are far off.</hi> But who fees not that it is the true portraicture of Confidence, which is a kinde of Hope; and that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> in that place pretended not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine that of Boldneſs? ſeeing that in that place where he was obliged moſt carefully to obſerve it's Nature, he ſays in expreſs terms, <hi>That dangers ought to be very near to provoke this Paſsion.</hi> Beyond all, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition ſoever he hath given it, he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not as a Paſſion, but onely as a Habit. Without ſtopping therefore at theſe things, which concern us not, let's fall on thoſe which are more important; and firſt, let us ſee whether it be true, That the Soul hath a deſign to aſſault and combate ill in all ſorts of Boldneſs.</p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47499:207"/>
                        <p>There are two things which make us doubt this propoſition, the firſt is,
<note place="margin">Whether all ſorts of Boldneſs aſſault ill.</note> That Boldneſs is not onely employed in aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ill, but alſo in reſiſting and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: Since a man may ſupport a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and ſuffer even death with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The ſecond is, that there are certain Boldneſſes, wherein there is no combate to be made, there being no apparent ill: As when a man runs into danger without knowing it, when he is impudent or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; for this conſiders nothing but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and boldly purſues them, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is bold, and takes delight to commit diſhoneſt actions, where it ſeems he hath no enemy to fight.</p>
                        <p>But theſe Reaſons are eaſily anſwered, for as for the firſt, although we may ſay, that reſiſtance is a kinde of combate, ſince the Soul cannot reſiſt but by oppoſition, and that to oppoſe, ſhe muſt ſtiffen herſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ill, which in ſome ſence is to aſſault and combate it; Yet it's certain, that ſimply to reſiſt ill, or conſtantly to ſuffer its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters and violence, without making any other effort, properly are not the effects of Boldneſs, but of another Paſſion which we call Conſtancy, or ſtaiedneſs of Courage, of which in the following Chapter.</p>
                        <p>As for the ſecond, it's moſt certain, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47499:208"/>there are thoſe which run into dangers without knowing it, and that in ſuch an encounter the Soul needs not aſſault the ill, ſeeing it ſees it not; but neither then is there Boldneſs: For as no man will ſay, that a blind man is bold when he paſſeth a precipice which he thinks not of; nor that a Childe is couragious that will touch the flame and take up coals of fire, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the effects thereof: It's the ſame of any other, who goes or lights into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which are unknown to him: He will onely appear Bold to ſuch as are like him, blind, or ignorant. In a word, the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite moves not it ſelf but through know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and when that enlightens it not, it remains immoveable, and forms no Paſſion. It muſt have an object to raiſe it; and if there be any which it knows not of, it is no more touched with it then if it were not at all. So that the danger which is unknown to him, is to him no danger, and therefore he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flies nor aſſaults it, and hath neither Fear nor Boldneſs for it.</p>
                        <p>It's true, that thoſe who are in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition do often ſeem to be bold, becauſe we ſee them in the midſt of dangers without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment, that difficulties ſtop them not, and that they march with aſſurance through thoſe obſtacles which preſent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47499:208"/>themſelves before them, but indeed are not ſuch as they appear, and they are rather poſſeſt with blindneſs and ſtupidity then with true Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>Yet it's that wherein we are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deceived, foraſmuch as it is nothing eaſie to diſcern thoſe deceitful ſigns from thoſe which are true, and chiefly when the Soul is agitated by ſome ardent Paſſion; for carrying her with precipitation whether ſhe would go, ſhe takes from her the thought of all what may croſs her, and makes her run after her object, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the lets and dangers ſhe meets in her way. Now it's certain, that then it ſeems to be Boldneſs, which inſpires her with that ardor, and which gives her thoſe noble motions. Although in truth it is not ſhe, but the impetuoſity of the Paſſion which tranſports her; And it is thus, that the ambitious, the proud, and the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſeem bold in ſeveral occaſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in effect they are nothing ſo, becauſe that not conſidering the difficulties which are in the purſuit which they make afree Honors and Pleaſures, they neither ſee them, nor do they aſſault them. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, we are to place in this rank the moſt part of thoſe who fear not dangers being accuſtomed thereunto as Souldiers
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47499:209"/>and Seamen, or having never tried them, like thoſe who engage themſelves in great undertakings, the difficulties whereof they never foreſaw, or becauſe they beleeve that they are not threatned by them, as ſuch as think themſelves far off, ſuch as are happy, ſuch as are good men, foraſmuch as honeſt men fear nothing. For it's certain, that in the moſt part of thoſe encounters Boldneſs is not, if you take it for a Paſſion. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as to ſome dangers are not known to be ſo, and to others they are reputed ſo, although they be abſent. Now ſo it is, that unknown or abſent ill raiſeth not Boldneſs, and therefore it is not really to be found in thoſe we have now obſerved, unleſs as a diſpoſition or a Habit. But we will have another touch upon this Subject.
<note place="margin">How Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence aſſaults ill</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's now ſee how Boldneſs which is to be found in Impudence may aſſault ill, ſince we cannot now ſay what we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it may be taken for a Habit, or for a diſpoſition, ſince Impudence is a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion compoſed of the other two, to wit, Pleaſure and Boldneſs: So that if there be nothing to be fought againſt in Impudence, there is ſome Boldneſs, which as a Paſſion is not obliged to aſſault it.</p>
                        <p>Certainly to be Impudent, we muſt know the action we do, is contrary to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47499:209"/>and honeſty, otherwiſe it were folly, or brutality, and not Impudence: For a Childe, a Blockhead, one that is ſenceleſs, is never eſteemed impudent, foraſmuch as they know not what actions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil.</p>
                        <p>He therefore that knows them, and hath an intention to do them, at that time feels in himſelf the reaſon which oppoſeth it, and the honor which defends him to execute it. Now all what oppoſeth it ſelf to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, is an obſtacle againſt it, and ſeems unto it as an evil; and yet Reaſon, Honor, and Modeſty are the Enemies which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence aſſaults, which ſhe fights with, which ſhe triumphs over. But we will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine this more particularly in diſcovering of this Paſſion. It's ſufficient to ſhew, That there is no Boldneſs which aſſaults not true or apparent ill.</p>
                        <p>We have nothing more to enquire,
<note place="margin">What the ill is which Soldneſs aſaults.</note> but whether all ſorts of ill can raiſe this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for beſides that it is not ſaid, that there is Boldneſs in fighting with Enemies which are weak, nor that any ought to accuſe his ignorance, impudence, or other defects which may be numbered amongſt the greateſt ills which can happen; Beſides theſe, and many other ſuch like reaſons which might be produced on this ſubject:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47499:210"/>I ſay there is no likelihood, that what is properly ill ſhould move this Paſſion, ſince that is nothing but a privation of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the ſoul nor ought, nor can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault what is not.</p>
                        <p>To reſolve this difficulty, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Soul acknowledgeth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this privation which we have ſpoken of, to be an ill, but even all the cauſes which it produceth, and all thoſe diſorders which cuſtomarily follow it. For there ever is ſome weakneſs or ſome inconvenience which follows the privation or abſence of a perfection; and this weakneſs or impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a real quality, as the Schools teach us; we may therefore ſay, that Privation which is a <hi>Non ens,</hi> is not an object which can excite Boldneſs, becauſe the Soul cannot aſſault what is not, unleſs ſhe fancy it as if it were a real thing, as it is with Children who conceive death as a fantaſm. That if there be any ill which ſhe ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, it's thoſe cauſes which ſhe brings forth, and the inconveniences which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And truly, ſhe commonly confounds thoſe two things with the ill it ſelf; for when we ſay, a man ſuffers death with courage, we do not preciſely underſtand it of death, for as yet it is not, but of the action of thoſe cauſes which deſtroy life,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47499:210"/>and of the grief which they raiſe; and when with conſtancy we ſupport the loſs of goods, of honor, or of health, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the loſs which occupies the conſtancy, but the impotency, the imcommodity and the affliction which are derived from thence.</p>
                        <p>It's therefore certain, that all true ills are capable to ſtir up Boldneſs, ſo as they be proportionable to our forces; for there are ills which of themſelves and by the common conſent of men, are ſo weak, that without fear or fight we ought to deſpiſe them; and others which are ſo powerful that its imprudence to aſſault them, and which in reaſon we ought to flie. That if the Soul conceives them otherwiſe then they are, and eſteems thoſe great which are little, and thoſe weak which are very powerful, there indeed the combate which ſhe undertakes againſt thoſe ſhe ought to ſlight, is a motion of Boldneſs; but this Boldneſs paſſeth for cowardiſe, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault which ſhe makes againſt thoſe which are above her ſtrength is Temerity; As it is audacity when ſhe ſlights, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if ſhe witneſſeth it by word or geſture. But we ſhall elſewhere have another touch upon theſe differences, which being not eſſential concern not this diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47499:211"/>we are onely to examine the Nature and Eſſence of Boldneſs. She therefore conſiſts in the aſſault which the Appetite makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ill; and this aſſault is made by darting it ſelf forth againſt it. Now we are to enqure how this darting forth is performed, and whether it be any way ſerviceable to the Soul, ſeeing that in caſting forth herſelf ſhe goes not out of her ſelf, neither doth ſhe approach nearer to her Enemy. But theſe difficulties have been cleared in the Treatiſe of Deſire, and ought not to be here repeated.</p>
                        <p>There remains onely one which might make us doubt of all what hath been ſaid,
<note place="margin">With what paſhons Boldneſs is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</note> did we leave it without examination and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. For although we confeſs that Boldneſs is a flying up, and a darting forth of the Appetite; yet becauſe it commonly accompanies Love and Pleaſure, and is never without Deſire nor without Hope; that even Hatred, Grief and Deſpair do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call it to their ſuccour, and that Anger is never without it; It ſeems there is no likelihood that this riſing up which ſhe makes can ſubſiſt with the particular emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every of theſe Paſſions, which ought to be different from hers.</p>
                        <p>We muſt then ſay, That it's nothing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to conceive for what concerns Deſire
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47499:211"/>and Anger, ſince in theſe two the Appetite darts it ſelf forth, as in Boldneſs, and that there is no other difference, but that Deſire requires not the eſtabliſhment nor the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Minds forces, as the other two do. And that neither that nor Anger have the ſame motives with Boldneſs, for Deſire caſts it ſelf towards the abſent good, to get near it; Boldneſs, againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ill, to combate it; and Anger againſt the cauſe of the ill to revenge it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>As for Hope wherein the Appetite ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens it ſelf, we have ſhewed how that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it not from caſting it ſelf forth, and truly it neceſſarily ought to be agitated with theſe two kinds of motions in Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Since to grapple with the Enemy he muſt throw himſelf upon him; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate him, he muſt fortifie himſelf, which he cannot do but by ſtiffening himſelf. Nay, even it's certain, that as Hope and Confidence always precede Boldneſs, the Appetite muſt neceſſarily ſtiffen and ſettle it ſelf, before it can either lift up, or dart forth it ſelf, as we ſhall hereafter declare. There is therefore no inconvenience but that theſe four Paſſions may mix and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt together. In effect they are all to be found in Anger; for this is never without Boldneſs, Boldneſs without Hope, nor
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47499:212"/>Hope without Deſire: And although De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire preſuppoſe Love, yet we cannot ſay that Love is to be found in Anger, becauſe it hath a contrary motion to the reſt. So that commonly neither that nor Hatred at the ſame moment are to be found with Boldneſs, but muſt paſs from the one to the other, as hath been already ſaid in the former Diſcourſes. Which is ſometimes performed with ſo much ſwiftneſs that it ſeems as if they mingled together, that they confounded themſelves, and never quitted one the other. Let's return to our firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and conclude, That Boldneſs is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that motion whereby the Appetite ſtiffens and darts forth it ſelf againſt ill, that it may combate it.</p>
                        <p>Now howſoever it be, the true ſence which we ought to have of this Paſſion, and that conſidering it exactly, and according to the Rules of Philoſophy, its eſſence and form muſt be all ſhut up in this motion; yet muſt we not altogether condemn the common opinion which conceives it not ſo ſimple as we make it, and who mix with it Courage, Aſſurance, Reſolution, Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the deſpiſing of danger. For although all theſe things are not eſſential to it, and are onely Diſpoſitions which ſerve to produce and preſerve it, We may yet
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47499:212"/>ſay, they are of her train, they make her appear, and that altogether they render this Paſſion perfect and compleat. They are indeed commonly confounded together, and they are all uſed to ſignifie one and the ſame thing: For we ſay a man of great heart and of Courage, a confident man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that fears nothing, and all to ſay he is Bold. And although it ſeems that this rather becomes the Habit of Boldneſs then the Paſſion; yet we forbear not to uſe them for the one and for the other; ſince we ſay an action of courage, an aſſured and reſolute look, a man who fears not danger, which are ways of ſpeaking, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly point at the Paſſion of Boldneſs. After all, without contradicting the uſe of terms, yet muſt we have the knowledge thereof, and diſtinguiſh the things which Nature hath ſeparated, and which the people have confounded.</p>
                        <p>Courage in effect is properly the natural power from which Boldneſs proceeds, as the Heart is the ſubject and principal organ of it. And foraſmuch as it is the moſt noble motion which that can have, and that the force of that part appears more in that Paſſion then in all the reſt, as its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, it hath gained the name of Heart; for to call a man Bold, we ſay he is a Man
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47499:213"/>of Heart, for that he that is Bold hath his heart raiſed up by the moſt noble of all the Paſſions. Or elſe becauſe his heart is as it ought to be; being hot and dry, which as we ſhall hereafter diſcourſe is its proper and juſt temper.</p>
                        <p>Now for Aſſurance, it's a pure effect of Judgment, which makes us beleeve our ſelves exempt from danger, and it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the certainty we have to be ſafe. Now becauſe this belief is a great diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to aſſault ill, and that he who beleeves himſelf to be in ſafety, fears no danger, thence it comes that we confound Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>Reſolution is another effect of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which without heſitation or ſtopping at thoſe doubts which the Enemies preſence inflicts on thoſe who are timerous, readily determines him to fight with him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this deſign thus taken is an effect of Courage, and of the good opinion a man hath of his own ſtrength, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions nearly related to Boldneſs, we confound them together: So that we take Reſolution for Boldneſs, and a reſolute man for a bold and couragious perſon.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, We call it Boldneſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe dangers, and not to fear them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that there is no Paſſion; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47499:213"/>as to deſpiſe an ill is a clear effect of Judgement; and not to Fear it, is nothing but the want and privation of Fear. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, becauſe it's the property of true Boldneſs not to value little ills which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually affright and aſtoniſh weak and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Spirits; and that in deſpiſing of theſe, and in aſſaulting the others, ſhe makes it appear that ſhe fears nothing; Hence it is we take that for Boldneſs which is only the effect of it, or to ſpeak to the purpoſe, which is onely the ſign of it. For not to Fear is no action but a privation; yet it commonly means the preſence of its contrary.</p>
                        <p>But what ſhall we ſay of Confidence, which the Greeks and Latins, and we our ſelves often admit for Boldneſs? It's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it's a kinde of Hope; or to ſpeak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it's the conſummation and perfection of it. For after the Appetite hath found Hope by ſtiffening it ſelf againſt the difficulties which environ the good it aſpires to; the Soul which ſees herſelf in a condition not to fear them, fortifies herſelf in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe had taken that the things ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects help from, will not fail her, and after a manner gives credit to the promiſes it ſeems to have made; Thus we truſt in our forces, in our goods, in our friends, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47499:214"/>as we then beleeve that what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed our ſelves of them will ſucceed.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe that we think there are no difficulties in this opinion which ought not to be overcome, and in purſuit that we fear not their encounter; thence it is that it hath been confounded with Boldneſs, which ought to have the ſame ſentiments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it onely is a diſpoſition which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes it.</p>
                        <p>However it be,
<note place="margin">What the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Boldneſs are.</note> and which way ſoever you will take theſe things, either as parts of Boldneſs, or for diſpoſitions which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede or accompany her; they ſerve to make known thoſe who are moſt ſuſceptible of this Paſſion: For Aſſurance and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deſpiſe, and not to fear dangers, are effects of the good opinion a man hath of his own ſtrength, without which there could neither be Aſſurance nor Reſolution, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage nor Boldneſs; laſtly, without which the ſlighteſt evils move terror; and even thoſe things themſelves which can do no harm, poſſeſs us every moment with fear.</p>
                        <p>Now this opinion is grounded on the forces we effectually have, or elſe believe we have; but becauſe they are of two ſorts; the one in us, and which depend from us, as the forces of the Body, and thoſe of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47499:214"/>the Mind; others which are without us, and which are not abſolutely in our power, as Goods, Friends, Honors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe who are endued with the former are moſt ſuſceptible of Boldneſs; ſo that a ſtrong and robuſtious man is commonly more bold then he that is not, and if he hath goods and friends alſo at his devotion.</p>
                        <p>But yet we muſt likewiſe obſerve that a man may be ſtrong and robuſtious ſeveral ways; for there is a force of Body which is only fit for reſiſtance for to bear; in a word, to ſuffer; ſuch is that of Camels, of Aſſes, of Oxen, and proceeds from a thick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. The other is purely active, and all of fire, which comes from choler, or from ſubtile and ſtirring blood, as is that of young Dogs, and of generous Horſes; the laſt is compoſed of the two former, and is obſervable in Lions, Maſtiffs, and in wilde Boars.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who have this ſtupid and paſſive force, ſuch as melancholy perſons are, are but little ſuſceptible of Boldneſs, being deprived of that heat which is as it were the ſonl of ſtrength and of courage; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are cholerick, which have that which is ardent and active, are eaſily carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with this Paſſion; but it hath this defect, that it quickly paſſeth away, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47499:215"/>that it diſcerns not thoſe ills which are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be combated, from thoſe which are not. The impetuoſity wherewith ſhe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, precipitating her deſigns, before Judgment can examine them: But thoſe who have both, and who are Cholerick and Melancholy, have the Boldneſs of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's, which is not ſuddenly kindled, but having once taken, it's long laſting; this fears nothing, it ſcorns little dangers, it aſſaults great ones with aſſurance and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and often with a tranſport which makes it to be thought divine.</p>
                        <p>After the ſtrength of the Body, we muſt produce the force of the Minde, for thoſe who think they have it, and promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great help from their addreſs and good Judgment, how weak ſoever they be, eaſily undertake great matters, and believe that they can ſupply the weakneſs of other things by the force of their Spirits. Laſt of all, thoſe who are powerful by their Dignities, by their Goods, or by their Friends, thoſe who never endured a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and who believe Heaven, Men and Fortune are favorable to them, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a good opinion of their forces, and are commonly Bold. But to take away all difficulties which may be made concerning theſe things, and to give that light which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47499:215"/>is neceſſary for clearing the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, where at every turn we are to ſpeak of Courage and of Forces, it's fit we ſhould more carefully examine the Nature of thoſe two, and examine wherein it is they conſiſt.</p>

                        <p>WE muſt firſt ſuppoſe that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is a quality proper to Animals,
<note place="margin">That Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is a power of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Now if there be as <hi>Ariſtoile</hi> will have it, but three things in the Soul; to wit Power, Habit, and Paſſion, this Courage muſt be ſome one of the three: Perhaps its no Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince it's very true that a man may have Courage, although he be agitated by none of the Paſſions, and even when he doth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47499:216"/>nothing; neither is it an Habit, becauſe it's acquired by uſe, and that a man may be born with Courage; it's therefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſhould be a Power.</p>
                        <p>But we muſt obſerve there are two ſorts of Powers, the one, firſt and radical; the other, ſecond, and derived. The firſt are parts or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable accidents of the ſoul, which for that reaſon are equal in all the individuals of every Species; So the power of Reaſoning conſidered in it ſelf, and as it is a Faculty of the Soul, is equally divided to all Men. Seconds are nothing but the diſpoſitions of thoſe organs which are neceſſary to make theſe firſt Powers move: Or to ſpeak out, they are the ſame Powers which the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Organs renders capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their actions. And as thoſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are unequal in their particulars, and that the one hath them more or leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then the other, ſo are they more or leſs fit to perform thoſe actions; ſo that we uſe to ſay of him who hath them perfect, and who is moſt proper to act, that he hath the power and natural Faculty to do ſuch a thing; and of him who hath them imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that he naturally hath an impotency and incapacity of working.</p>
                        <p>Now Courage is undoubtedly of the number of thoſe derived Powers, becauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47499:216"/>it requires certain diſpoſitions in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans proper to elevate and ſtir up the Soul againſt difficulties; and the principal of theſe diſpoſitions is nothing but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat of the heart capable to kindle and inflame this noble ardor, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in theſe encounters.</p>
                        <p>But we muſt here conſider two things.
<note place="margin">What that Power is which makes Courage.</note> Firſt, What this radical vertue is, which enters into the Courage, ſince the natural and derived Powers are nothing elſe but the radical, in that they are joyned with their diſpoſitions; certainly we muſt ſay, that Nature which hath diſtributed to all Animals as much ſtrength as was neceſſary for their preſervation, hath alſo given them the vertue to raiſe up and employ them when they have need of them. And this vertue is nothing but the iraſcible Faculty, which is the principle, and as it were the form and ſubſtance of Courage: Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as inflaming the Heart, and lifting up the Soul, it doth nothing elſe but move the natural forces of the Animal to oppoſe them againſt thoſe difficulties which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves. And indeed theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the effects of Courage are drawn from the quality of the forces; for as there are ſome which are proper for the Soul, and others which belong to the Body, every one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47499:217"/>hath its particular Courage, which ſtirs it up and ſets it on work; ſuch a man will be couragious in the greateſt dangers of War, who dares not ſpeak in publick, or will ſuffer himſelf to be overcome by the leaſt Paſſion. On the contrary, there are others who in ſuch like occaſions have courage, who loſe it at the ſight of a weak Enemy, or of the leaſt little danger they encounter; and this proceeds from that the Courage being a vertue which ſtirs up the forces, when they fail it ought alſo to fail; and therefore thoſe who are deprived of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrength ought to be cowards in War, and couragious in the actions of the Mind and Judgment, if they have the forces which belong to thoſe two Faculties. Finally, as the forces are deſtined to aſſault or to reſiſt, as we ſhall make it hereafter appear, the Courage alſo employs them in both the one and the other of thoſe actions, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit brings forth two different Paſſions, Boldneſs which aſſaults evils, and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Strength of Courage which oppoſeth it ſelf and reſiſteth their violence.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing which we ought to know is,
<note place="margin">Why beat is the principal diſpoſiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>n of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> why Heat is the principal diſpoſition that creates Courage, and what conditions are requiſite for to produce it. The firſt is eaſie to be decided, becauſe Heat is the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47499:217"/>moſt active of all the qualities, that it ſtirs up all the other natural Vertues, and makes the beſt part of the Bodies vigor; neither need we to be aſtoniſhed, if the Soul being joyned to ſo powerful a quality, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the help ſhe can draw from thence, have a good opinion of its forces, and if ſhe truſt in them, and if ſhe readily oppoſe them to thoſe difficulties which preſent themſelves.</p>
                        <p>As for the conditions which this Heat requires to form Courage,
<note place="margin">What that heat ought to be which forms Courage.</note> there muſt be three principal ones: The firſt that it muſt be natural; the Second, that it muſt be great and ſtrong; the third, that it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the greatneſs of the Heart.</p>
                        <p>In effect, a ſtrange Heat as that of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, although it inflame the Heart and the Spirits, yet it augments not the Courage, on the contrary it abates it, as not being confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Nature. Now for it to be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, it muſt have two things; One that it muſt be born with the life, and that it muſt be as it were a continuation of that firſt flame, which was kindled at its firſt birth; for if it be once extinguiſhed, there is no means left to reinflame it; and how temperate ſoever that might be which may be ſubſtituted in its place, yet would it be ſtrange and uſeleſs; The other is,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47499:218"/>that it muſt remain within thoſe limits which Nature hath preſcribed; foraſmuch as every thing hath a certain meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which it ought not paſs, without breaking that proportion which ought to be betwixt the organs and their principles to perform their Functions; ſo that that heat which is more violent then the nature of every Animal can bear, is not natural unto it.</p>
                        <p>But how conformable ſoever to Nature it may be, unleſs it be great, it never will be accompanied with Courage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who are of a cold temperature, as Flegmatick and Melancholy perſons are, thoſe who are attenuated with long ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with long griefs, and who by other Paſſions quench natural heat, are not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious.</p>
                        <p>Yet it is to be obſerved, that natural heat being not a ſimple quality, as that of Fire is, but a hot and moiſt ſubſtance, which is commonly called Spirits compoſed of the <hi>Humidum Radicale,</hi> and of this heat which Nature inſpired with life, it may be great two ways; to wit, in quantity and in quality; that's to ſay, that there may be much of the Radical Humidity in it, or many degrees of that heat: So Children have more of that natural heat, as to the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47499:218"/>quantity, as thoſe which are older have much more as to the quality. So in the Winter and in cold Climates, the ſubſtance of heat is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, becauſe not diſſipated, and exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or cold hinders it from iſſuing out; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be leſs burning then in Summer, the coldneſs of the Air ſomewhat diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its vivacity. On the contrary the ardor of the Climate, or of the ſeaſon draws forth a great part of the ſubſtance of Heat, and imprints in what remains a certain acrimony which renders it more violent.</p>
                        <p>Now although all actions are performed by means of natural heat, yet there are ſome which more depend on its ſubſtance, as concoctions and digeſtions are, being to be made by means of humidity; ſo that thoſe who have moſt radical moiſture as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, perform theſe operations moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, although they have a very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat, ſuch as it ought to be for ſuch actions.</p>
                        <p>But there are alſo thoſe which more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the quality of heat, as are the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Imagination, and thoſe which we call Vital; for thoſe who have the moſt ardent heat, have the ſtrongeſt reſpiration, the moſt vehement heart beatings, and the moſt fertile Imagination.</p>
                        <p>Finally, There are thoſe which equally
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47499:219"/>require both, as thoſe which employ mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the forces of the Body, and ſuch Courage is. For it is not ſufficient to make a man couragious, to have much radical moiſture, ſince Children which have much of it have but little Courage; nor to have a more ſharp and and vehement heat, ſince in the Summer, and in very hot Climates where the humors and ſpirits are inflamed by the heat of the Sun, men are but little couragious; but he muſt have both much humidity and much heat: Since in effect, we ſee that people which inhabit the moſt temperate Countries are more couragious then thoſe of the South and North, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more radical moiſture then thoſe, and a heat more active then theirs. Even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Beaſts, thoſe which are of a hot temperature, and whoſe blood is thick, are moſt couragious, for the ſame reaſon, becauſe they have much of the ſubſtance of Heat, which is not eaſily diſſipated, being ſhut up and reſtrained by ſuch humors as are groſs; and beſides their heat is ſtronger, as well by reaſon of the advantage which Nature hath afforded them, as becauſe ſhe raiſeth many vapors which render it more ſharp, and that ſhe reſides in a thicker ſubject which renders her more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatious.</p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:47499:219"/>
                        <p>And truly according as humors are groſs or ſubtile, heat diverſly operates, and alſo forms ſeveral kinds of Courage; for thoſe which have them ſubtile and moveable, as the Cholerick, are ready to be inflamed, but it's a flame which laſts not, but its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſpent; others which are groſſer, and moderately hot, have a Courage which is not eaſily provoked, but which being heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is with difficulty appeaſed. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, thoſe who are violently hot, and whoſe humors are groſs, fall eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fury, and are of an undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
                        <p>But that which makes the principal diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in all theſe things,
<note place="margin">What the greatneſs of the Heart ought to be to make Courage.</note> is the greatneſs or littleneſs of Heart. For it's obſerved that all thoſe Creatures, which proportionably to their Bodies have a leſs Heart, are coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, as the Dog and the Lion; and that thoſe which have a greater, as Deer and Hares, are timerous. Yet there are other experiences which render theſe obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doubtful; for even Man hath a Heart greater then all other Creatures in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Body, although he be one of the moſt couragious. It's certain, that large-Cheſted men have a great Heart, and that the breadth of the Breſt is an undoubted mark of the Hearts heat, which cauſeth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47499:220"/>Boldneſs and Courage: Conſidering alſo that thoſe, the temperature of whoſe Heart is cold and dry, have commonly that part very ſmal, and are the moſt timerous. To anſwer to theſe Reaſons which deſtroy the precedent Propoſition, there are ſome who ſay that it's only true in the ſeveral kinds of Beaſts, comparing the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not in the individuals of the ſame Species; So that the Lion compared with the Stag hath a leſs Heart, and is more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious; but that amongſt Lions he that hath the greateſt Heart, hath the greateſt advantage over that which hath a leſs; yet this voids not the difficulty. For although it be true, that amongſt every kinde of Creatures which are naturally couragious, the greateſt Heart is accompanied with the greateſt Courage: It's alſo certain that in thoſe that are naturally timorous, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heart denotes alſo the greateſt Timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                        <p>We muſt then ſay that the greatneſs of the Hearts doth nothing of it ſelf, as to the Courage, and that we muſt add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the abundance of heat and ſpirits; for if the Heart be great, and that it hath much heat and many Spirits, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly produce a very great Courage. But if the Heart be ſmall, and that it hath as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47499:220"/>much heat, and as many Spirits, as that which is great, it will make a more boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a more impetuous Courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heat is more active when it's ſhut up and reſtrained; but that alſo is the cauſe that it is not ſo noble and generous; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that conſtraint makes it eaſily paſs to fury, and that the ſmalneſs of the parts is an effect of the weakneſs of the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vertue, or a defect of the matter which in the principal parts is always vitious. On the contrary, if it have but few ſpirits, and but little heat, it makes Timidity; and in proportion as it is either large or ſtreight, it will render it litile or great. For even as a little fire warms a great Chamber leſs then the ſame would do a little one: So likewiſe a little natural heat, works leſs ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in a great and large Heart, then in one that's little and reſtrained. Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Timidity be common to both, it appears leſs in this, and is greater in the greater.</p>
                        <p>We have now nothing to add to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this buſineſs, but to reſolve two very conſiderable Doubts which may ariſe from the former Diſcourſe. For if the Courage conſiſts in the diſpoſitions we have now ſpoken of, two things will follow which ſeem to combate Reaſon and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47499:221"/>1. That Courage will onely be in the ſenſitive part, becauſe thoſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are all material and ſenſible; although it be true that there be many which out of meer Reaſon onely are valiant and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, without having this heat in the Heart, which we have obſerved. 2. That that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal which hath not theſe diſpoſitions, will never be moved by any Boldneſs, ſeeing he will want the Courage which is a power whence this Paſſion proceeds; and yet it's certain, that the moſt timorous in divers encounters perform actions of Boldneſs and of Courage, and that the weakeſt are moſt ſuſceptible of choler, which is a kind of Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>We muſt then ſay that there are two ſorts of Courage,
<note place="margin">There are two kinds of Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> the one which belongs to the ſuperior part, and the other which is in the ſenſitive Appetite. For ſince the Ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcible Faculty is the principle, and as it were the ſubſtance of Courage, it muſt needs be that the Will which hath its iraſcible part, muſt alſo have its particular Courage, and muſt be as much different from that which is in the Appetite, as the Will is from the Appetite it ſelf. It's true, that Courage conſiſts not onely in the iraſcible vertue, but that it ſuppoſeth alſo in it a certain diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which makes it the more eaſily ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47499:221"/>for an Animal is not couragious for having the iraſcible part, but for having of it ſuch that it eaſily may move it ſelf againſt difficulties. But this diſpoſition ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the nature of the ſubject wherein it is; and it muſt neceſſarily be, that if it be in the Will, it muſt be different from that which is in the Appetite, and conſequently that there muſt be two kinds of Courage. Now as the preſence of heat which makes the beſt and moſt conſiderable parts of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrengths, produceth this diſpoſition in the ſenſitive Appetite, the force of the Minde and of Reaſon works the ſame effect in the Will: It inſpires a ſecret ſence of its power, and of the ſuccour ſhe may draw from thence; it fills it with confidence, and leaves it a certain facility and readineſs to oppoſe it ſelf to thoſe difficulties which preſent themſelves wherein Courage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, as hath been already ſhewed. Such is that which accompanies the excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Mind, whether they be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or acquired. For a knowing man, hath the courage and boldneſs to ſpeak; he that is vertuous, boldly oppoſeth himſelf againſt his Paſſions; and an expert Artiſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes things in his Art, in which others durſt not engage themſelves, becauſe that every of them have forces neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47499:222"/>what they undertake, and that the will which knows what they can do, is ready to ſtir them up and employ them when it pleaſeth.</p>
                        <p>Now although theſe two kinds of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage may one ſubſiſt without another, yet they are far ſtronger when they are joyned together, and aſſiſt one the other. For a man whom Vertue or Knowledge hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with Courage, is more bold in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking any thing, if he have that fair fire which at his birth is kindled in his Heart, then if he had a coldneſs which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that part languiſhing, and cauſeth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Timidity; even as he whoſe tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath rendred him couragious, is far more reſolute when the qualities of his Mind may ſecond his natural diſpoſition. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, were there but one ſort of Courage, a man would be very ſenſible of the ardor it would inſpire; we ſhould know the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors it makes in it ſelf, and the many things which it propoſeth every moment the performance of. But the cowardlineſs which would be in the other part of the Soul at the ſame time, diſſipates thoſe fair reſolutions. It checks all thoſe noble mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and corrupts all the good deſigns it had formed. Thus it is with thoſe who having all the advantages of the Mind, dare
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47499:222"/>never produce themſelves; and others who have much Heart, dare undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                        <p>But although this be the true ſence a man ought to have of this power of the Soul; yet we muſt confeſs, that when we ſpeak of Courage, we commonly mean that which our births ſhed into our hearts, and which is proper to the ſenſitive Appetite; becauſe it's common to all Creatures, and that its effects are moſt ſenſible and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
                        <p>As for the other Doubt which reſpects Courage; To wit, whether the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have obſerved, be always neceſſary to its production, is no leſs diffiult to reſolve; For if it be true that Boldneſs is an effect of Courage, contrary to the experience which we have, thoſe Animals which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally timerous, can never be ſuſceptible of this Paſſion: Or that contrary to the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims which we have eſtabliſhed, Courage ſhould not depend on thoſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, we muſt here again ſay, that the common manner of ſpeaking ſits not ſo well the truth of the thing; for there is no Animal which hath not Courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is none without ſome heat, for that its neceſſary to life; and how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47499:223"/>it hath, it's capable to give that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the iraſcible Vertue, which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to make it undertake ſomething. In effect, there is no Animal which at every moment finds not ſome difficulty which it's obliged to oppoſe. And we every day ſee that the weakeſt and moſt timorous make endeavors to ſurmount the obſtacles they encounter; they muſt therefore have Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, <hi>Since Courage is nothing but the iraſcible Vertue, which the Natural heat of the Heart hath rendred capable of working.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this capacity is greater in ſome, and leſſer in others, the greater hath deſerved by its prerogative the name of Courage, as the leſſer is called Cowardiſe, or want of Courage. So that even as we ſay a man hath no wit becauſe he hath but little; we alſo ſay an Animal hath no Courage, becauſe he hath but little: And certainly if we ſhould well conſider this gender of Qualities which the Schools call Natural Impotencies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the default of Courage ought to be placed, we ſhould find that it is different from Power only in reſpect of leſs or more. And that the word of [Impotency] means onely a weak Power, and not the abſolute privation of Power, becauſe it's a quality, and quality is a real thing. So the default of Courage is rightly Courage, but it's little,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47499:223"/>weak, and hid, which operates but ſeldom, and undertakes but light Skirmiſhes, or at leaſt, if it engage in greater matters, it muſt be very much ſollicited thereto; and the difficulties muſt have powerfully provoked it, as it happens in the Anger of timorous perſons.</p>
                        <p>Laſt of all, the common way of ſpeaking affords not the name of Courage, but only to him who is moſt active, who boldly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf to the greateſt dangers, and who is always ready either ro aſſault or to defend himſelf. But to have this Courage, and to be called couragious, a man muſt have all the diſpoſitions we have ſpoken of. So that when we ſaid that Boldneſs was an effect of Courage, we conſidered Courage in its Nature, and not according as it's u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in our Language. For it's true, that this paſſion cannot proceed but from the iraſcible Vertue, in that it can operate, and when it operateth it's called Courage; but it is not always that active and boiling Courage, which marks a great facility of operating, for that it is neceſſary there muſt be much natural heat in the Heart to give it this faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. All which will be better underſtood when we ſhall have examined wherein Force or Strength conſiſts.</p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:47499:224"/>
                        <div type="section">
                           <head>Of Force.</head>
                           <p>To ſpeak generally, Force is a quality which firſt and properly belongs to Power, Faculty, or Vertue, and by its means to thoſe actions which it produceth, and to the ſubject it's found in. So we ſay that the natural Faculty is ſtrong, that it's ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ſtrong, and that the parts it reſides in are ſtrong: Now the Vertue is ſtrong, when it can perfectly, and with efficacy produce its effect; and it's capable of it, when it hath thoſe diſpoſitions which are neceſſary for its operation. So that Force or Strength conſiſts in theſe diſpoſitions, which proportionably as they are more or leſs perfect, make that alſo more or leſs great, and its Vertue to be leſs or more ſtrong.</p>
                           <p>Yet it's very true,
<note place="margin">To what the name of Force is moſt properly to be applied</note> that although in that ſence, Force be a quality common to all Powers, as well Spiritual as Material, all of them having need of certain conditions and diſpoſitions to operate; yet ſo it is, that to ſpeak abſolutely of Strength, all kinde of Strength is not to be underſtood, nor all ſorts of Vertues; For when for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we ſay, That Force is neceſſary to aſſault, That an Animal or a Body is ſtrong,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47499:224"/>it is not to be underſtood of all the Forces it may have, as of the force of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, of the ſences, and of the like, but of a certain particular Strength, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more noble and more excellent then the reſt by its prerogative, hath deſerved ſimply &amp; abſolutely to be called Force; and it's that which the Paſſions of the iraſcible Appetite uſe, the nature whereof muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſequently be here inquired. To this purpoſe we muſt ſuppoſe, that all the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe being compoſed and filled with things which are contrary and oppoſite one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, there is nothing which can be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in without Enemies which aſſault and ſeek to deſtroy it. So that it was the providence of Nature which gave unto all things, not onely thoſe Vertues which were neceſſary to perform their ordinary, and as it were, domeſtick functions, but even thoſe which ought to defend them from foreign aſſaults, and hindering them from receiving thoſe violences which it might receive from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. 'Tis for this reaſon that every thing hath its proper qualities to preſerve its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as alſo others to deſtroy its contrary; and that thoſe Animals where thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are more diſtinct, and leſs confuſed, have two different Appetites. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible, to ſeek for themſelves what is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47499:225"/>fit, and flie what is hurtful; and the iraſcible to reſiſt ill, and if it be needful to aſſault and deſtroy it. But becauſe there is more trouble and action to reſiſt and aſſault, then ſimply to purſue good, or flye from ill; and that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are the more noble, the more active they are, as we have ſhewed elſewhere; it is certain, that in this reſpect the iraſcible Appetite is more active and more noble then the Concupiſcible; and therefore thoſe Forces which are the Inſtruments and the diſpoſitions which it hath to work, are alſo more excellent and more conſiderable then the reſt. It's alſo the reaſon for which the name of Force is due unto them out of excellency; and then when we ſpeak ſimply of Force or Forces, we ever underſtand thoſe which are deſtined to reſiſt and to aſſault.</p>
                           <p>Now becauſe all Philoſophers and all Phyſitians are agreed,
<note place="margin">The force of corporal things conſiſts in the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature.</note> that the Force of all the corporal Powers conſiſts in the temperature which is proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unto them, becauſe the temperature is the firſt and the moſt efficacious of all the Diſpoſitions which the Faculties finde in the matter; and that the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fitneſs which ought to be betwixt the inſtrument and the cauſe, require this temperature ſhould be proper and natural to the Faculty, as is before ſaid, ſpeaking
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47499:225"/>of that natural heat which forms the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; This Maxim, I ſay, being certain, we muſt ſee what this Temperature is, which ought to ſerve the Iraſcible Appetite; ſince it's a material Power. Certainly, ſince it is to aſſault, it hath need of heat, being the principle of action in Animals; and ſince it ought alſo to reſiſt, it hath alſo need of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is the principle of this reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Now there is no temperature which hath theſe two qualities, but either the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Melancholy, or the ſanguine Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, foraſmuch as Choler and Blood are Humors which furniſh heat; and that Melancholy which is Terreſtrial affords dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſolidity, and ſtability.</p>
                           <p>In effect, all Animals which are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrong and couragious, are either Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Melancholy, as Lions and Dogs; or Sanguine Melancholy, as Bulls, Bears, and wilde Boars. And if we obſerve what hath been ſpoken of the Hero's in former times, we may eaſily judge they were all of the ſame complexion; and that choler and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Diſeaſes, to which they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are certain marks of this temperature; In fine, he that will conſider the body of a ſtrong and robuſtious man, will ſee that all parts anſwer theſe two qualities. That a ſtreight figure, a large Breſt, quick Eyes, a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47499:226"/>ſtrong Voice, and all vigorous motions proceed from that heat which extends and animates the organs; as the bigneſs of the Bones and Joynts, the bigneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, the firmneſs of the Muſcles, the hardneſs of the skin comes from a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and terreſtrial drineſs, which renders the humors thick, and the members ſolid.</p>
                           <p>Now if it happen that heat alone predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates, it will indeed produce Courage and Strength, but it will be an impetuous and a boiling ſtrength, proper to aſſault and not to ſuſtain. On the contrary, if drineſs be there without being ſeconded by heat, it renders the force ſtupid and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, which ſerves to reſiſt and not to aſſault, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                           <p>But we muſt here obſerve two very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable things.
<note place="margin">Wherein the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conſiſts</note> Firſt from the example of Phyſitians, we muſt not here take the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the onely mixture of the firſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but alſo for all the other diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the matter, as are ſecond quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the conformation of parts, and the concourſe of ſpirits. As when we ſay that Force conſiſts in a hot and dry tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we underſtand not that the parts are ſimply hot and dry, but alſo that they are of a thick ſucculent and firm conſiſtence, that nothing is wanting to their conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47499:226"/>and that the ſpirits ſlide therein eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abundantly. For if this tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meets with a ſubtile and looſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is to be ſeen in thoſe purely chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, it will indeed produce Courage, but the Forces thereof will not be perfect, and cannot long neither maintain a Combate, or a ſtrong aſſault, becauſe the ſpirits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſſipate themſelves, and that the parts have not that maſſive and firm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence which is neceſſary for reſiſtance; and ſhould they even have theſe conditions, if they receive not thoſe ſpirits which are neceſſary for their functions, or if there be any notable defect in their conformation, they will be weak, and cannot execute the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which the Appetite impoſeth on them.</p>

                                 </gap>.</note> That the Appetite which is the principle of all thoſe motions which Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals make, uſeth two principal faculties, which have the direction of thoſe actions; to wit, the Vital Faculty which reſides in the heart, and in the Spirits; and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vertue which is ſeated in the Brain, and in thoſe organs which depend on it; ſo that it's chieſly in thoſe parts which we are to conſider, and wherein this tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereof we have ſpoken ought to be.</p>
                           <pb n="72" facs="tcp:47499:227"/>
                           <p>But becauſe the Iraſcible Appetite is it ſelf placed in the Heart, and that the ſtrength of that part is conſequently nearer unto it, then that of the other organs of Motion; and that we may in ſome ſort ſay, that they are Arms which it hath in hand, or its domeſtick Forces, and that it leads them it ſelf; and this is the reaſon it hath more confidence in them then in others, and that they alone are capable to give him both Courage and Boldneſs.</p>
                           <p>For the heat of the Heart is a violent and impetuous Miniſter, which inceſſantly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licites the Soul to follow its motions, which abuſeth it out of the oſtentation it makes of its forces, and perſwades it, that with them, and without other help it can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake all things: It's properly an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Favorite, which engageth his Maſter in a difficult War, without conſidering the weakneſs of the State. He hath Courage, Arms and Men; but the Nerves of War are wanting, neither doth he ſee that his Allyes cannot favor him: So when Force is alone in the Heart, the iraſcible Appetite may well ſtir up thoſe noble Paſſions, and declare War againſt its Enemies; but the Nerves and Muſcles not ſeconding its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, its Enterpriſes are vain and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. On the contrary, when the Heart is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47499:227"/>weak, the Appetite is languiſhing and lazy; and although the Members are robuſt, it truſts not their Forces, and thinks it a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor too far off to make uſe of in ſuch ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſions. Let's then conclude, That that Force which is neceſſary to aſſault and to reſiſt, principally conſiſts in the hot and dry temperature of the Heart; and that that may be perfect and accompliſhed, it muſt be accompanied with that of the Nerves and Muſcles.</p>
                           <p>But there are ſtill two great difficulties to be decided. The firſt is,
<note place="margin">The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces belong to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſcible Appetite.</note> That all thoſe Diſpoſitions of the iraſcible Appetite ſerve alſo the concupiſcible; for beſides that Heat and Spirits are neceſſary for all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Life, and that Love and Deſire are ardent and impetuous Paſſions, it muſt needs be that thoſe Creatures which are to go, flie, or ſwim, and which are often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to run after good, ſhould have diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions neceſſary to perform theſe great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to wit, Heat and Firmneſs; thus Force will not be particularly affected to the iraſcible part, but it will be always in common to the concupiſcible, which yet is contrary to our ordinary Philoſophy, which will have that different Vertues muſt have different Diſpoſitions.</p>
                           <p>To anſwer theſe Reaſons, We ſhall firſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47499:228"/>ſay, That it's true, all different Faculties require different diſpoſitions. For if they are with things which ſerve to many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Actions, there muſt needs be ſome diverſity which makes this difference, which every particular action requires. So natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat which ſerves as the univerſal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to all the functions of life, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified according to thoſe operations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thereunto; it muſt for ſome be moiſt or dry; for others, great, little, or temperate, and every one hath its porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and meaſure different from all the reſt. We then confeſs that the Concupiſcible and Iraſcible Appetite both employ Heat and Spirits, and that there muſt be firmneſs in the motions of either of them. But there is this difference, that the one requires a ſweet heat, moiſt, and pleaſant; and that the other will have one that is lively, dry, and pungent, for the Reaſons we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after deduce: And that that firmneſs which appears in the motions of the Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible part, is outwards and purely acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, not being to be found in the Soul, and happening to the parts out of neceſſity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead that in others, it's firſt found in the iraſcible Appetite, which afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates it to the organs; for this Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite onely can ſtabliſh it ſelf, and when the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47499:228"/>Soul ſuffers this kind of motion, it even forms ſome Paſſion of the iraſcible Appetite. Indeed this eſtabliſhment of the Soul ſeems to be the proper agitation of the iraſcible Appetite, becauſe there is no motion more efficacious to reſiſt and aſſault then that which reunites the Vertue which hinders it to yeeld, and which renders the aſſault the more ſtrong; ſhe alſo makes uſe of it in all generous Paſſions; and if ſhe caſts herſelf into Boldneſs and into Anger, it's certain, ſhe firſt ſettles herſelf. And the onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which there is betwixt the motion of Deſire and that of Boldneſs is, that at firſt the Soul darts it ſelf forth without ſettling it ſelf, and that in the other it performs both together, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                           <p>The other difficulty is,
<note place="margin">How Force is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from Courage.</note> That if Force conſiſt in the heat of the Heart where we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have placed Courage; it muſt follow that Force and Courage are the ſame thing; What ever is ſaid, that a man hath Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but wants Force; and that Force and Courage muſt be joyned for the execution of great Deſigns. We therefore ſay, that heat alone may make Courage all entire; but that it makes but a part of Force. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Courage is the power it ſelf, and Force is to be conſidered as the inſtrument
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47499:229"/>of this power. For heat is not Courage, but it produceth in the Faculty this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and capacity of operating, which we call Courage; inſtead whereof we may ſay, that Heat is Force, or at leaſt that it is a part of Force; yet muſt we not from thence conclude, that Force doth not belong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and in the firſt place to Power, becauſe the nature and eſſence of the Inſtrument depends wholly from the relation which it hath to its Cauſe; and were there no Cauſe, there would be no Inſtrument. So Strength being the Inſtrument of Power, it properly and primarily belongs to it, and by its means to thoſe actions and ſubjects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is. But it's to go too far into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of the Schools. Let's return to our Diſcourſe of Boldneſs, and ſee what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it produceth in the Spirits and in the Humors.</p>

Indeed he that will conſider the countenance of a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he aſſaults ill, but who onely ſees it coming, will perceive no ſign of this ſally of the ſpirits, foraſmuch as he changeth not colour; and that fire which we ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards glitter in his eyes, appears not; for it's certain, that if theſe ſpirits caſt themſelves on thoſe parts, they would carry thither red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſplendor, and would not leave them that coldneſs and equality with which he looks upon, and conſiders dangers.</p>
                        <p>And truly ſince we muſt grapple with the Enemy to aſſault him, and that the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors we ſhould make againſt him would be vain and uſeleſs, were he out of reach, the Soul would never riſe up nor dart it ſelf forth againſt it, did ſhe fancy it to be ſtill far off, and not near enough to prove her force, and reſent the effects of her power. All what ſhe doth in this encounter, is, to fortifie and prepare herſelf for the combate; Firſt, ſtiffening her ſelf in her ſelf, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards inſpiring the ſame motion to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47499:230"/>ſpirits, and the reſt of the organs, which may be ſerviceable to her in this occaſion; in purſuit whereof it follows, that a mans color changeth not, that his looks are ſtaid, and that without growing pale or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſturbance he looks on the moſt formidable things, becauſe the ſpirits which are mixt with the humors, and which cauſe all the other parts to move, ſtiffening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, render them firm and ſettled, and by that means hinder the blood from ſhedding it ſelf abroad, or from retiring inwardly, not that thoſe other motions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy either reſtrain or render themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous.</p>
                        <p>This then is the agitation which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſuffer in the beginnings of Boldneſs, or to ſpeak better, in thoſe preparatives which the Sonl makes for this Paſſion; For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, Hope, Confidence, and Staiedneſs of Courage, which are the fore-runners thereof, require this kind of motion, and without it can neither form themſelves nor ſubſiſt.</p>
                        <p>But after the Enemies approach, and that the Soul is riſen up to aſſault and fight him, ſhe moves the Spirits in the ſame manner, and all ſtiffened as they are, ſhe with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity drives them forth to the exterior parts, and ſo carries redneſs to the face, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47499:230"/>and vivacity to the eyes, and violence to all the motions, as we ſhall hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
                        <p>Now to explain how this darting forth is made, we ought here to repeat all what hath been ſaid in the Chapter of Deſire; for there is no difference in the motions of theſe two Paſſions, as to the agitation, ſince both in the one and the other the Soul iſſues as it were out of it ſelf, and caſts it ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the object which moves it: They are onely unlike in the end ſhe therein propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth herſelf; ſince in Deſire ſhe carries her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards good, that ſhe may get near it, and thereby afterwards enjoy it; and in Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe darts herſelf towards ill, that ſhe may combate and overcome it. It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here we muſt ſeek that ſatisfaction which this ſubject requires. As alſo in the Diſcourſe of Hope, that which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make us underſtand how the ſpirits ſettle and dart forth themſelves at the ſame time, we are onely to obſerve, that when we ſaid, that the motions of Deſire and of Boldneſs were alike, it ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this darting forth. For its certain, that the Soul never ſtiffens it ſelf in Deſire unleſs it be accompanied with Hope, with Boldneſs, or with Anger; foraſmuch as ſhe ſtiffens herſelf onely to fortifie herſelf,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47499:231"/>and that ſhe needs not employ her ſtrength unleſs difficulties preſent themſelves, which are not in the Paſſions of the Concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part, as elſewhere hath been already ſaid.</p>
                        <p>Now the firſt thing which follows this motion,
<note place="margin">Whence the Heat comes that raiſeth up it ſelf in Boldneſs.</note> is, the heat which ſheds it ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Body, and which by degrees aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it ſelf, and proportionably as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity grows greater. For at firſt, before the ſpirits darted themſelves forth, when they kept themſelves onely firm, this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was very moderate, as it is to be found in Hope; but when they begin to make their fallies and dartings which drive and throw them forth, it's then that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes violent, and that at laſt it inflames all the parts. But the difficulty is to know whence this heat proceeds; for although there be an appearance which the agitation of the heart and of the ſpirits cauſeth, ſince it's a Maxim received in the Schools, That Motion hath the vertue to produce; yet beſides the experience which we learn, that Air and Water cool themſelves by agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that the ſhock and encounter of Bodies, by which we ſay heat is engendred, hath no place in thoſe which are ſubtile and fluid, it is certain that there are Paſſions where the heart and the Spirits have a very
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47499:231"/>quick and impetuous motion, as we ſee in Fear, yet even in them heat augments not, but even weakens it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>For my part, I beleeve that without ſticking at common opinions, we may ſay that the Heart being the ſource of heat, hath alſo the vertue of producing it; and that being to loſe this quality as a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of all the functions of life, it muſt have the power to augment it according to the need we may have. Why ſhould we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it this Faculty, ſince there is no form which produceth not thoſe qualities which are neceſſary unto it? The Water of it ſelf alone, doth it not take back again the cold which was taken from it? Doth not the Earth alſo recover the drineſs it loſt? but what is moſt conſiderable, Doth not Heat augment it ſelf in preſence of its contrary? And if it be true that that which inflames the Heart in violent paſſions, proceeds not from motion, as we have ſhewn even now, what other ſource can it have, but this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertue we ſpeak of? In fine, ſince the Soul reſides in this part as in its Throne, and that ſhe is therein ſtronger then in any other part, what need we doubt but ſhe helps this production? She who in her ſelf contains the vertue of all inferior things, as we have ſhewed in the diſcourſe of Light.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47499:232"/>We muſt therefore beleeve, that the Soul and the Heart augment the natural heat when it is neceſſary, and that in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their endeavor, and ſtirring it ſelf to produce it, they cauſe it to iſſue out of thoſe principles where ſhe potentially was.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, Since the Soul hath Forces which ſhe imploys when ſhe will, which ſhe awakes and ſtirs up at her need, ſhe muſt needs have the ſame power over natural heat, which is the moſt conſiderable part thereof, and that ſhe may raiſe it up and encreaſe it when its help is neceſſary. And certainly as the motive Vertue contains <hi>in potentia</hi> the motion which it afterwards produceth, when it hath received the orders of the Appetite; So the Vital Faculty hath in it ſelf a ſecret ſource of Heat, which it ſtirs up and brings to light, if we may ſo ſpeak, when the Soul commands and judgeth it neceſſary. Now there is no occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this ſuccour is more profitable for her, then when ſhe expects the ill either to reſiſt or to combate it, becauſe ſhe hath then need of its Forces, which principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in heat, as we have made it appear in the precedent Diſcourſes: But foraſmuch as there needs more Forces to aſſault then to reſiſt, that is the cauſe that there is leſs heat in Hope and in Conſtancy, where the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47499:232"/>Soul ſtands on the defenſive, then in Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and in Anger, where ſhe aſſaults and deſtroys ill. As alſo that in theſe two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the agitation of the ſpirits is greater; for we do confeſs that their motion ſerves for ſomething, not of it ſelf, but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as we ſay in the Schools, becauſe they bring the heat which they have, and that of the humors which they draw after them, to thoſe parts where they light, and ever ſollicite the fixed heat which is therein entertained, to awake and to render it active.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe Paſſions which oblige the Soul to flight, they make a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect, and becauſe the Spirits retire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the centre, and the Soul alſo finding it ſelf too weak to reſiſt the Enemy, loſeth all its Courage, nor cares it to repair its ſtrength, and ſo ſuffers the natural heat to be extinguiſhed without endeavoring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle it.</p>
                        <p>But that we may well conceive what the endeavor is ſhe makes in other Paſſions,
<note place="margin">Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>t the quality of heat is in Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> we muſt not conſider the quality of the heat which accompanies them, and compare it with that which is obſerved in thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ſeek good; for in theſe it is ſweet, humid and graceful; and in thoſe it is ſharp, dry, and pungent. So that it's very likely that in the firſt the Soul em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47499:233"/>it and ſheds it abroad without violence, and in the other ſhe raiſeth it and drives it forth with impetuoſity, that in thoſe it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly needs its ordinary vertue, and in theſe it muſt be greater and more active. Finally we may ſay, That in the one ſhe uſeth it as a follower accompanying of her to her friends, but in the other it's an Aſſiſtant which ſhe leads with her, even againſt her Enemies.</p>
                        <p>In Love indeed, in Deſire, and in Joy the outward parts receive not heat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's ſent thither, but becauſe it flies from thoſe ſpirits which are ſent thither, foraſmuch as the Soul needs not that quality to approach or unite it ſelf to good, but only the Spirits which force it to the place where it is. On the contrary, when ſhe is to fight, ſhe ſends heat as a powerful inſtrument to act, and to deſtroy what is contrary unto it; as alſo in this deſign ſhe renders it as ſtrong as ſhe can, whether it be by degrees aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting it, or ſtirring up the Spirits by a continual agitation, or in removing the humors when ſhe is moſt active, as chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick are.</p>
                        <p>And certainly, what the ſenſitive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth in theſe encounters, the natural alſo doth it very often in thoſe ordinary functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as is eaſily judged by the Feavor,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47499:233"/>which is juſt like Boldneſs and Anger, the ſame heat, the ſame tempeſt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Humors, and the ſame deſign which the Soul hath in thoſe Paſſions it encounters in that diſeaſe. For we muſt not think that the Feavor is kindled in the Heart by ſome ſtranger fire. It's the Soul its ſelf, or rather the Vital Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which reunites its force, which ſtirs up natural heat, and which lifts it ſelf up to fight thoſe cauſes which deſtroy the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and conſtitution of the Body. This is readily proved by its criſis, which are thoſe fits of the Feavor which the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of Nature, and not the Diſeaſe ſtirs up; by the inflammation which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſpirits and of the blood cauſeth in the infeſted parts, by the ceſſation of the Feavor in the heighth of the ſickneſs, when the Humors are ſo malignant that Nature is overcome with them, and that ſhe dares no longer aſſault them; And by a thouſand other Reaſons which we might produce, had we room for them; by which we might evidently make it appear that the Feavor is nothing but an innitation and a riſing up of natural heat to drive away the ill; and that therefore it's a motion like to that of Anger, and that in the loweſt part of the Soul, as well as in the higheſt there is an
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47499:234"/>Appetite which hath its iraſcible Faculty to raiſe it ſelf up againſt thoſe difficulties which preſent themſelves. However it be the Soul encreaſeth Heat in Boldneſs and in Anger, producing and adding new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to what it had, and ſtirring it up by the continual agitation of the Spirits.</p>
                        <p>For although they ſtir themſelves impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly in Love,
<note place="margin">Boldneſs entertains the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirits.</note> in Deſire and in Joy, yet their motion is not therein maintained; and the Soul takes no care for their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the tranſport and the raviſhment which the approach, or the poſſeſſion of good affords her, bereaving her of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what ſhe ought to do, for which cauſe languors and ſoundings follow theſe Paſſions, unleſs Hope, Boldneſs, or the like, mix not with them, and call back the Soul to her Duty, as it often happens in Love and in Deſire, which being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanied with Fear and Hope ſuffers not ſuch great and violent accidents as thoſe in Joy are; the Soul therefore is more careful to continue the motions of the Spirits in Boldneſs and in Anger, then in the reſt of thoſe Paſſions, becauſe the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhe is threatned withal keeps her in breath, and continually ſollicites her to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe new forces, and to make new endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors againſt the preſſures of the Enemy,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47499:234"/>which ſhe cannot do, but by producing every moment new Heat and new Spirits, and ſending them to relieve thoſe which made the firſt aſſaults.</p>
                        <p>Nay often,
<note place="margin">What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are moved in Boldneſs.</note> as if ſhe miſtruſted her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors, when the ill appears too powerful, ſhe raiſeth up the moſt working and the moſt malignant Humors that thereby ſhe might the more eaſily deſtroy them. From thence it is that Choler is ſtirred up in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of thoſe Paſſions; and that in veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Beaſts, that poiſon which is quiet and hid in the centre of the Body, caſts it ſelf forth into the outward parts, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into thoſe which ſerve them for arms and defence; which may oblige us to judge that it's the Soul which brings it into thoſe places to aſſault and deſtroy the ill, and by a very probable conſequence, that ſhe doth the like with thoſe others which have any proper quality for that purpoſe. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Truth, we need onely to conſider thoſe dreams which are formed when cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler predominates; for they evidently make it appear, that the Soul is accuſtomed to uſe this humor to aſſault evils, and that preſently as ſoon as ſhe ſees it in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be thereby relieved, ſhe prepares herſelf for the Combate, and during ſleep ſhe forgeth Enemies, Battels and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47499:235"/>At leaſt its certain, that Choler be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agitated in theſe Paſſions, renders the Heat the more ſtrong and pungent. Or becauſe it's naturally dry, and that drineſs is a quality which gives moſt efficacy to Heat, or becauſe thoſe ſharp fumes which this humor exhales, when it's moved, caſt themſelves on the parts, prick them and give them that angry ſentiment which the heat of thoſe Paſſions uſeth to cauſe.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>TO follow the ſame method we have held in our former Diſcourſes,
<note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Boldneſs.</note> we muſt here examine two ſorts of Characters; the one immediately formed in the Soul, which we call Moral, becauſe they conſiſt in thoſe actions which we call Moral, or at leaſt which reſpect Manners. The other which are Corporal, and which are remarked in the change and alteration which this Paſſion imprints on the Body. Thoſe of the firſt order which accompany Boldneſs, are truly very numerous, as may be ſeen in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription we have made of a Bold man; but we may reduce them to certain principal Heads, the knowledge of which will eaſily
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47499:235"/>bring us to that of the reſt: For he that ſhall know why a Bold man Hopes, and why he is a lover of Glory, will at the ſame inſtant know the cauſe of the greateſt part of the other effects which Boldneſs produceth, and which in ſome ſort depend from thoſe two.</p>
                        <p>Let's then begin with Hope which ever precedes Boldneſs, and never abandons it;
<note place="margin">Hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Boldneſs.</note> Certainly, it's nothing difficult to give the reaſon thereof; for after having ſhewn that to form Boldneſs, the Soul muſt know and meaſure its Forces, that ſhe muſt beleeve them greater and more powerful then thoſe of the Enemy, and afterwards ſhe muſt employ them againſt him, that ſhe may vanquiſh him; It's impoſſible but ſhe muſt hope for the Victory, ſince ſhe deſires it, and that in her judgment ſhe hath all what is neceſſary for the obtaining thereof. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome will ſay, that there are many who fight without hope of conqueſt; it's true, but alſo Boldneſs which is employed in ſuch fights, is not found in the ſenſitive Faculty; nor is it of the common order of the Paſſions. It's particular to a man whoſe reaſon prepareth often other deſigns then thoſe which Nature and the Sences are wont to inſpire in Animals; For its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they never aſſault any thing which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47499:236"/>they beleeve not they ſhall conquer; and if ſometimes they are forced to combate Enemies, which they did not dare to aſſault, or even before whom they had already been put to flight, it's the fear they have of falling into a greater danger, which awakes their Courage, reanimates their Force, and ſo brings to life again the hope of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming thoſe to whom they had yeelded before. But it is not ſo with men, who often engage themſelves in Combates, and caſt themſelves into dangers, out of which they never hope to come with any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and even where they know their loſs is certain, becauſe Reaſon propoſeth them a more conſiderable end then the Victory would afford them, and obligeth them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake impoſſible things, to gain honor, and other goods,, which always follow ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous actions. But if in theſe encounters they deſpair of over-coming the Enemy which aſſaults them, they ſtill hope to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh thoſe difficulties which inviron the glory they aſpire unto; and we may ſay they yeeld a ſmall Victory to gain a greater, and hazard a little to gain much. But in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter we ſhall again touch this ſubject. It's ſufficient to have here ſhewn that in Boldneſs there is ſtill Hope enough, and that a Bold man is never without Hope.</p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:47499:236"/>
                        <p>Now the ſame principle from whence we have drawn this truth, ought alſo to furniſh us with the reaſon why a Bold man hath ſo much Confidence and Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in himſelf, why he is not aſtoniſhed at the ſight of dangers, that even he is pleaſed when he encounters them, and that very often he deſpiſeth them; why he is not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, cholerick, or diſſembling; In fine, why he hates ſubjection, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways command.</p>
                        <p>For if Confidence be nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated Hope, fortified by the opinion we have that thoſe things whoſe help we expect will not fail us at our need, it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Soul which knows its forces, and beleeves them more powerful then the difficulties, and employs them againſt them with Hope to overcome them, muſt alſo be aſſured that they will not fail her in this occaſion, and that ſhe hath cauſe to truſt to the help which ſhe promiſeth herſelf from them.</p>
                        <p>As for Preſumption, which is an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Hope, and proceeds from the too great opinion we have of our Forces, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it doth not always accompany Boldneſs, yet it follows it, becauſe heat encreaſing, and kindling it ſelf in this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it ſtirs up the Soul by its vivacity. It
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47499:237"/>troubles it, by its agitation, and afterwards eaſily perſwades it, that its forces are greater then indeed they are, and that they are all in a condition to ſerve her, although there often be but one part of them; thus it is when Wine, Fury, and Love inſpire the weakeſt and moſt timorous perſons with a blind Confidence, and a temerous Boldneſs, which engageth them to undertake things above their power; for the Judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weakened by the vapors of the Wine, or by the violence of thoſe Paſſions and heat, being become ſtronger by the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it made on the humors, we need not wonder if the Soul finding it ſelf upheld with the moſt powerful aſſiſtance which ſhe can uſe in her functions, be deceived in the opinion ſhe hath of her ſtrength, and that ſhe believes them greater then indeed they are.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Reaſons make it appear alſo,
<note place="margin">A Bold man is not aſtoniſhed at ſight of dangers.</note> that a bold man <hi>ought not to be aſtoniſhed at the ſight of dangers,</hi> becauſe aſtoniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever accompanied with Fear and with ſome Deſpair, cannot be ſuſceptible of thoſe Paſſions in the belief he is, that his forces are greater then the difficulties, and in the hope he hath to overcome them. On the contrary, as he flatters himſelf in this thought, and placeth all his happineſs in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47499:237"/>the Victory, all theſe things which are to contribute thereunto are pleaſing to him; he takes a delight to handle Arms, the found of Trumpets animates him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Enemies approach with joy; and if there be any thing which diſturbs his contentment, it is the impatience he hath to be at him, and to begin that Combate which is to crown his valor. It's the ſame with him who is bold to ſpeak or to write, or to undertake any other deſign whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be; he pleaſeth himſelf in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of thoſe difficulties which are to employ him, and to make his courage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; the place, the occaſion, the ſubject of his enterpriſe far from aſtoniſhing him, do but the more aſſure him, and he is never ſo content, as when he ſees himſelf ready to ſet his hand to the work.</p>
                        <p>But if it be true that he runs thus into danger, that he aſſaults difficulties,
<note place="margin">A Bold man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth dangers.</note> and that he will overcome them, how can he <hi>deſpiſe dangers?</hi> For it is not to ſlight an Enemy when we aſſault and ſeek to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. Certainly, we muſt confeſs that he deſpiſeth not all manner of dangers, not all ſorts of Enemies, but onely thoſe who are far beneath his ſtrength, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he judgeth it unworthy for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his care and Courage; for ſince in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47499:238"/>Nature which gives Animals the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their ſtrength and weakneſs, and inſtructs them to flie when they are too weak, and to aſſault when they are ſtrong enough; its very likely that being ſo wiſe and ſo juſt, as ſhe is, ſhe would not engage them in a too unequal combate, and that ſhe would reſtrain them when they meet an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy incomparably leſs powerful then they are, and which cannot offend them. In effect we ſee that among domeſtick Beaſts, thoſe which are naturally ſtrong and of a great ſize, ſcorn the aſſaults of thoſe who are little and weak; a Maſtiff grows not angry, nor ever defends himſelf againſt a little Cur which barks at him, and ſnaps at him, as if he ſcorned his temerity; he goes on without regarding him, or ſtands ſtill without being diſturbed at the endeavors he makes againſt him. A child ſecurely plays with the moſt angry Beaſts, beats them with impunity, and hurts them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moving them, which they would never ſuffer from another perſon.</p>
                        <p>Some ſay the ſame of thoſe which are wilde and ſavage; and ſome of them have deſerved the name of generous, not onely becauſe they diſdain to aſſault thoſe who are not able to reſiſt them but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they often content themſelves to caſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47499:238"/>down their adverſary, as if in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it were unworthy for them any more to exerciſe their ſtrength, and that it were a ſhame for them to end a Combate which they had made ſo unequal. It's true that they forbear not often to purſue the moſt timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous creatures; but it is not as Enemies, it's as their prey; and it's not to fight them, but to take them and feed on them; in a word, it's Hunger and not Boldneſs which animates them; for when they are not preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this hard and implacable neceſſity, they never aſſault but onely thoſe which they think ſtrong enough to harm them, and ſcorn the reſt which have not that power.</p>
                        <p>Whatever we believe, it's certain that when the Soul is perſwaded that the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which preſent themſelves are too weak to traverſe her deſigns, ſhe ſcorns and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to fight them. Now this perſwaſion is grounded on the certain knowledge which ſhe hath of the greatneſs of her forces, or on a falſe opinion which ſhe hath conceived of them. For although thoſe who are truly ſtrong and powerful, have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make no reckoning of the greateſt part of thoſe things which alarm others; yet when Boldneſs hath heated a Courage, how weak ſoever it be, it abuſeth it by a vain confidence it gives it, and makes it believe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47499:239"/>that the obſtacles it meets are nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that there are none which ought to ſtop its courſe, or which is able to make the leaſt reſiſtance: This is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the anger of Women, of Children, and of Men who are naturally timorous; they fear all before they are poſſeſt with this Paſſion; but when this hath gotten maſtery, ſhame, reſpect nor danger can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bridle them. They ſlight all that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their fury, and blindly run whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rage and deſpair leads them.</p>
                        <p>Since Boldneſs ſcorns the greateſt part of difficulties and dangers,
<note place="margin">A Bold man is not chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</note> neither can it be Cholerick or Superſtitious, becauſe Anger and Superſtition are not compatible with the confidence it hath, nor with the deſpight it hath of moſt of thoſe things which aſſault it.</p>
                        <p>And indeed we are not angry with what we ſcorn, becauſe this Paſſion raiſeth not it ſelf up but againſt things which may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and that ſcorn ſuppoſeth that they are without that power. So that if a Bold man do very much ſlight Enemies and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, we may at leaſt ſay, that he meets not with ſo many ſubjects of anger, as he who is not in that condition. Moreover if it be true that Anger comes from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we have to have been offended, he that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47499:239"/>that preſumes much of his ſtrength, and values not that of another man, never hath a thought that he can be offended: Thus Magnanimous Men, and thoſe which are naturally ſtrong and couragious, are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily angry, becauſe Reaſon perſwades the one that moſt injuries are not ſo in effect, or that they are ſo ſlight that they deſerve not to be revenged; and their ſtrength makes others beleeve, that it's impoſſible, or at leaſt very difficult for any to hurt them. Laſt of all, if there are Boldneſſes which are ſuſceptible of this Paſſion, it's at leaſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the true and heroick is not for the Reaſons beforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>Neither is it Superſtitious,
<note place="margin">He is not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</note> becauſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition proceeds from weakneſs and fear, with which Boldneſs could never ſubſiſt; and truly it was never ſeen that a bold man did heed or give any credit to Auguries and to all other vain obſervations which have been introduced by Superſtition. Thoſe great Men of times paſt, although they were bred and inſtructed in thoſe errors, did often deſpiſe them. And <hi>Homer</hi> forgot not to ſay That his <hi>Achilles</hi> ſtopped not on the preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which were told him of his death; That <hi>Hector</hi> mocked the Augurs, and that in heat of fight he ſcorned both men and gods.</p>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:47499:240"/>
                        <p>To ſpeak truth, Boldneſs having ſo great an opinion of its Forces, beleeves not that it needs foreign help, and its preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on making it forget that natural inclination which Nature hath given to men to have recourſe to Heaven in their neceſſities, far from becoming ſuperſtitious, it falls to the deſpiſing of divine things, and eaſily gives it ſelf up to Blaſphemy, Sacriledge and to all other impieties, which we ſee reign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, he that ſhall conſider the ſource of Superſtition, will finde no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the weakneſs of Men, and the miſtruſt they have had of their own Forces. For beleeving themſelves expoſed to all kinde of injuries, and being inſtructed by Nature that there was a Power above theirs, they did ſeek it every where, to gain ſuch relief as was neceſſary for them: Thoſe who were baſeſt did believe to finde it in mortal and corruptible things, and ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them the worſhip which was onely due to the true Divinity. Others indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it immortal, but have divided and multiplied it into as many gods as there were things they ſtood in need of. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, all men which are born weak, being moved by fear or miſtruſt, imagined it was hard to be inclined and to be pleaſed, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47499:240"/>there ever was ſome want in the duties which were rendered unto it, and that to render it exorable, new reſpects ought to be added to thoſe which Reaſon had already dictated unto them; and to obſerve all thoſe extraordinary things which were as Oracles, which it gave them of their good or ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, theſe are the ſprings whence all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry hath flown; the vain obſervations of things to come, and the ſuperfluous Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in the true Religion. In fine, theſe are the undoubted witneſſes, that all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition proceeds from weakneſs and from fear, and that it's a Vice proper only to weak and timorous perſons, as may be judged alſo by Women and melancholy perſons, to whom it's more familiar then to any; By Southern people, who have ever been accuſed of Cowardiſe and of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and by perſons that are unhappy and over-burthened with miſery, who eaſily fall from Piety to Superſtition.</p>
                        <p>Freeneſs is alſo one of the Companions of Boldneſs,
<note place="margin">He is free &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note> becauſe a man who believes himſelf ſtrong enough to overcome his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, will never call Artifice or Treachery to his help, which are ſigns and common effects of weakneſs. Indeed all timorous Animals are more cunning and crafty then the reſt. Women are naturally more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47499:241"/>then Men, as amongſt them the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly are more ſuſpicious and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling. Now this happens from that they are conſcious of their own weakneſs, and therefore are obliged to uſe Artifice and deceit to ſupply the defects they have. Boldneſs then is not ſubject to theſe Vices, ſeeing it hath ſo much confidence in its Forces, and ſpeaks freely and open-hearted; its procedure is free, neither is there any deceit or treachery to be feared from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it fears nothing. By reaſon whereof there have been ſome Captains, who have often been hardly perſwaded to uſe ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, which are even allowed by the Laws of War, as if they were unworthy of their Courage and of their Valor. We every day ſee that in the heat of a Battel, and when Boldneſs is higheſt, we deſpiſe the rules and poſtures of Fencing; and even thoſe who are naturally weak and timorous, when they are animated with this Paſſion, or tranſported with anger, they forget their ſlights and ſubtilties, and purſue their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with open force.</p>
                        <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">It will always command.</note> 
                           <hi>It hates ſubjection, and would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways command;</hi> for having a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſelf, it's perſwaded that it ought never to ſubmit it ſelf, and that it deſerves to have the preheminence above all the reſt.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47499:241"/>And certainly, although this inclination be common to all men, who being born free, think that their Liberty ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved more intire, and more abſolute in command then in ſubjection; yet there are ſome to whom it ſeems more natural and more proper then to others, becauſe they truly have, or think they have thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are fit for command. Now if ſtrength be one of the moſt conſiderable, and if it be the moſt powerful, and perhaps the onely Inſtrument of Dominion, we need not doubt but Boldneſs which fills the Soul with ſo much confidence, and gives her ſuch an advantagious opinion of her ſtrength, doth alſo powerfully imprint this haughty and imperious humor, which makes him take the upperhand in all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and renders him incapable to ſubmit himſelf to the advice and conduct of another: Whence it happens that Bold men are commonly haughty, and but little courteous; that they are opinionative in their reſolutions, and that they will always be the head both in Councels and in Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes. In fine, its one of the cauſes which makes Mutineers and Rebells in a State, which make Hereticks and Atheiſts in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and which fills families with diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and with licentiouſneſs: For all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47499:242"/>theſe diſorders can proceed from nothing but a preſumptuous Temerity which will not ſubject it ſelf to lawful Powers, which will be independent in all things, in a word, which will Command.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Head which muſt lead us to the knowledge of the other Characters which we ſeek, is the Love of Glory; for he that ſhall well underſtand the Reaſon why a Bold man hath this inclination, will at the ſame time perceive why he affects Praiſe, why he is modeſt, generous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's then conclude,
<note place="margin">Boldneſs deſires honor more then all the reſt of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> That there is no Paſſion which inſpires the deſire of Honor and Glory like unto Boldneſs; for if they are recompences or duties which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give to the excellency of perſons, Boldneſs is the onely one which gives us the right to exact the debt, ſince it alone gives men the ſuperiority and excellency which they ſeek ſo ardently. In effect, all the Paſſions whoſe object is good, in ſome manner ſubject man to the good he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues; thoſe which flie ill, oblige him to yield to the ill as the more potent; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy indeed reſiſts it, and yet commonly ſhe beleeves not herſelf ſtronger then it, ſo that this onely dares aſſault it, and hopes to conquer it, which is more powerful, and which ought to inſpire the ſentiments of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47499:242"/>excellency and of ſuperiority, whoſe juſt price is honor. Now Boldneſs alone hath this advantage, and if Anger pretends any ſhare, we know it is from that Boldneſs is always of its company.</p>
                        <p>But why doth it fancy <hi>That there is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to be gotten in all its undertakings?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">It fancies honor in all its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes.</note> ſince its a ſtrange thing, and hardly to be found in the reſt of the Paſſions, that the worſt actions it produceth ſhould appear glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and praiſe-worthy; certainly it is becauſe they are led by Force and by Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which are qualities which Nature hath rendred ſo noble, having deſtined them to be the foundation of power and of ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it's impoſſible but all their effects muſt alſo be ſo, and but that conſequently they muſt deſerve the honor which is due to the nobility and excellency of the things. And this is ſo true that men have form'd the firſt knowledges which they had of Vertue on actions of Force and Courage; At firſt they knew none but that which was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein; at leaſt it appears that they gave it the firſt place, ſince they honored all the reſt with that name, which ought to have been proper and peculiar unto it; for amongſt the Grecians, the word which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Vertue,</hi> draws its original from War; and amongſt the Latins, thoſe who ſpake
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47499:243"/>moſt purely, did beleeve that the name of <hi>Vertue</hi> was in the firſt place due to the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Vertue. And this in my opinion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, from that nature which deſtined man for a civil life, hath alſo inſpired in him an advantageous ſence of all thoſe things which are neceſſary to maintain it; now becauſe none is more ſo then that Vertue which conducts Force and Courage, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone having right to command, to eſtabliſh order in Society, and reſiſt thoſe enemies which would deſtroy it, it's certain, that naturally we ought to have more eſteem of it then of all the reſt, whoſe object is a good leſs common, and leſs conſiderable; for this reaſon alſo more care hath been always taken to render it more duties and reſpects then to any whatſoever. At all times, and in all kindes of States, the moſt worthy and the moſt noble rewards have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for it; the firſt Crowns which ever were, have been conſecrated to it, and it's the onely one to which the glory of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs hath been deſtined for the reward of its actions, which is the higheſt top of all the honor of the earth.</p>
                        <p>As it is then a Vertue which Nature it ſelf obligeth us to reſpect by reaſon of its being deſtined to the government of a civil life, we muſt not wonder if that Paſſion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47499:243"/>which ſerves for matter and inſtrument to thoſe actions, pretends the ſame right, and bearing with it the ſame deſtination, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that by a juſt claim it ought to have the ſame advantage in all its enterpriſes. For although Reaſon make it appear, that Temerity, Cruelty and Inſolency, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vices which ſometimes are mixt with it, render it unworthy ſo noble a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: yet ſo it is, that it doth not always hearken to their devices, and that it more willingly follows the inclinations of nature; ſo that looking at nothing but what is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and having no other guide but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct it hath for glory, it imagines it ought everywhere to encounter it, and that it's a prize due to all its actions, how evill ſoever they be.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moderation</hi> in victory, <hi>Modeſty</hi> in ſpeech,
<note place="margin">The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Boldneſs.</note> 
                           <hi>Generoſity, Sweetneſs and Courteſie</hi> towards the vanquiſhed, accompanies not all kind of Boldneſs, but onely that which is conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Reaſon: For Paſſion alone is not able to produce ſuch perfect actions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being guided by vertue. But as regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Paſſion forbears not to be Paſſion, we may ſpeak theſe to be the Characters of Boldneſs, ſince they are proper to one kind of Boldneſs; Add alſo that there are ſome ſeeds and diſpoſitions in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47499:244"/>of this Paſſion, which naturally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it inclined to produce theſe actions; for there are generous Beaſts which content themſelves with the Victory, and which hurt not thoſe they have thrown down: we ſee even that all Bold men although they have not Vertue to regulate their Boldneſs, and that they propoſe not honeſty to ſerve them as the motive, forbear not to act the generous and the modeſt, even like thoſe who have true Valor. And what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination ſoever they have to take all the advantages they can over their Enemies, yet they reſtrain themſelves, and render not their Victory inſolent. Now this part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens from that natural Juſtice we ſpoke of, which defends Beaſts from purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Combate which is too unequal, and partly from the violent deſire of honor which this Paſſion inſpires in men. For finding himſelf continually preſt with this ſecret ſpur, and by experience knowing that inſolency and vanity diſhonor a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry how brave ſoever it were; That on the contrary, Moderation, Modeſty, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity render it the more glorious, they eaſily are moved to thoſe actions which ought to content their deſire, and which promiſe them the richer harveſt of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and of praiſe, for which cauſe we had
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47499:244"/>reaſon to ſay, that their <hi>Modeſty was proud and ambitious,</hi> becauſe they conſider not the Honeſty which vertue propoſeth therein, but the glory onely which redounds from thence, and that they reſpect Honor but even for Honors ſake.</p>
                        <p>Beſides,
<note place="margin">Whence thoſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come which mix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Boldneſs.</note> although in theſe occaſions they follow this ſhadow and appearance of vertue in all other ways they commonly are Arrogant and Proud, becauſe eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves more then others, they think all is their due, and will have the preheminence, as we have already ſaid; <hi>They boaſt and ſpeak advantageouſly of themſelves,</hi> foraſmuch as the heat of the Paſſion kindles the deſire they have of glory, and makes them ſeek praiſe even from their own mouths; and certainly we need not doubt but that Boldneſs is the ſource of all thoſe defects; but when it appears baſe, artificial, cholerick, or cruel, we muſt not lay the accuſation of theſe vices upon it, but the ill inclinations onely whereto it's received; For it is like that of torrents which enter into great Rivers, and ſeem preſently to break the courſe of the water, and to make a paſſage from one ſhore to the other, yet their impetuoſity muſt yeeld to the current of the River, which ſwallows them up, and carries them away with it. What Paſſion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47499:245"/>alſo ſoever it be which is mixed with the ill inclinations, muſt follow the courſe they take, and ſuffer it ſelf to be carried away with thoſe defects and vices which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto it. Now theſe inclinations come from the temper, or from cuſtom; for this corrups the beſt Natures, and there are men whoſe births have given them all the diſpoſitions which are neceſſary to true Boldneſs, yet which have thoſe defects which we even now mentioned, having for a long time been nouriſhed in them; and the habit they have gotten hath changed all thoſe ſeeds of vertue which Nature had given them.</p>
                        <p>But beſides cuſtom, the general ſource of their ill inclinations is in the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<note place="margin">The effect of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> and chiefly in that whence weakneſs proceeds; for it's that which makes men undertake baſe actions, unworthy of a true courage, perſwading them they muſt fear all things, that no enemies are little, and that we ought even to aſſault thoſe enemies which are weak, or thoſe which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defence. It's that which makes them become <hi>Artificial and Perfidious,</hi> foraſmuch as it would ſupply the defects of thoſe forces by cunning and deceit, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid: It's that which renders them <hi>Cholerick and Vindicative,</hi> becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47499:245"/>to all manner of injuries, that it's eaſily hurt, and that the vengeance it takes is a neceſſary means to keep the reſt in their duties. Finally, it's that which makes them <hi>Cruel and Bloody,</hi> becauſe in that miſtruſt which it hath of it ſelf, what advantage ſoever it hath over its enemies, it ſtill doubts that it wants ſtrength ſufficient to effect its own revenge; ſo that to put it ſelf in ſafety, it moves even to extreme violence, and ſo renders its victory brutal and cruel. But we ſhall more particularly examine theſe things in their due place. Let's finiſh this picture by thoſe ſhadows which Fear gives unto Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>For we have ſaid,
<note place="margin">Whence that fear comes which ſomtimes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> that Fear often went before that which was the moſt noble and the moſt generous; that on the contrary there were men who went boldly into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and preſently after loſt their courage; that the moſt part of the moſt valiant, durſt not ſpeak in publick; and that ſome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe apprehended the encounter of ſome things which were but little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
                        <p>To give a reaſon for theſe extravagant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, we muſt firſt remember, that there are two ſorts of Boldneſs; the one which is led by Nature, the other which is regulated by Prudence. The firſt conſiders not always
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47499:246"/>the greatneſs of the danger it's engaged in, or elſe it wants ſtrength to entertain a long-winded combate; Wherefore when it finds the danger greater then it imagined it to be, it's ſurprized with aſtoniſhment, which makes it take ſlight; which commonly happens to new Souldiers, and to thoſe who undertake things without having fore-ſeen the difficulties which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were to have been encountred. And if it be upheld by this active and glittering force which accompanies delicate tempers, as thoſe of Children, of Women, and the like, its firſt fury and firſt impetuoſity is onely to be feared; for its forces being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to furniſh it for a longer fight, it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives ground, and makes way for Fear, unleſs ſome new relief arrive. But it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not ſo with that Boldneſs which is conducted by Reaſon; before that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Combate, it exactly conſiders the forces of the Enemy, the greatneſs of the danger it is entering upon, and all thoſe obſtacles which may traverſe its deſign; for which cauſe it hath not at firſt that impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ardor which is to be obſerved in the other. On the contrary it appears cold and reſtrained; and ſometimes even paleneſs, trembling, and ſuch other accidents of Fear which ſurpriſe it in theſe encounters,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47499:246"/>do ſo hide it, that a man might beleeve that it was not there at all, or that it was aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with its enemy. And certainly the Soul might conceive the danger ſo great that for a time ſhe may not be capable of any motion unleſs it be that of Fear; and in that caſe ſhe could not be agitated with the Paſſion of Boldneſs, although ſhe might have the habit thereof. Now although we muſt ſay, That the image of the danger being carried to the ſenſitive Faculty by the Knowledge which the Sences or the Judgment may have given her, the Soul will form Fear in the inferior part, whilſt the ſuperior will be raiſed with a true Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and then a man will boldly go to the fight, whom we ſhall ſee look pale and tremble at the ſound of the Trumpet, and at firſt ſight of the Enemies. Its true, this diſturbance will not laſt long, Reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently getting the maſtery either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuring it ſelf, or raiſing the Courage of its inferior part. Neither after a man hath taken this noble reſolution, is he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of Fear or of Aſtoniſhment; he meets with no difficulties which ſeem not leſs then he fancied they were; and if his ſtrength fails him in this occaſion, his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue forbears not to hold faſt, and obligeth him rather to periſh then to flye, or rather
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47499:247"/>yeeld to undergo the burthen, then quit his undertaking.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe who valiant as they are dare not ſpeak in publick, or who fear the encounter of certain things which in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ought not to give them the leaſt apprehenſion, beſides that this rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the habit of Boldneſs then the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it's an examen which more fitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the diſcourſe of Fear then to this: We can onely ſay, That a Bold man is not ſo in all things, becauſe he hath not, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth he hath not competent forces to undertake them, and to ſurmount the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which are therein to be encountred, every profeſſion, &amp; even every action requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring its particular forces. Such a man may have the one, and want the other; ſo he may be bold in thoſe and timerous in theſe. He who is naturally valiant and couragious, hath not commonly thoſe diſpoſitions which are fit for the great actions of the Mind; Coldneſs and Quietneſs which they require, cannot allay themſelves with heat, and that tumult which accompanies Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: So that if he finde himſelf engaged to ſpeak in publick, or to do any other the like action, aſtoniſhment and fear ſurprize him, being ſenſible of his own weakneſs to execute a deſign beyond his ſtrength.</p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:47499:247"/>
                        <p>We are now to examine the Characters which Boldneſs imprints on the Body,
<note place="margin">The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Boldneſs.</note> which as in the reſt of the Paſſions, are of two kinds. For ſome of them are formed by the Souls command, and the others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowingly, and out of a neceſſity, uſeleſs to her deſign, as we ſhall make it appear in the examen we intend of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                        <p>Let us therefore begin with the Eyes, which afford us the ſight of all, and which are the Souls Looking-glaſſes.</p>
                        <p>An aſſured Look, although it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the generons Paſſions of the Iraſcible Appetite, belongs particularly to Boldneſs, becauſe ſhe aſſaults ill, and that ſhe ought to have more aſſurance then the reſt, which do onely expect it; For we have ſaid in the Diſcourſe of Hope, That this Look was made by a wide opening of the lids with a fixed ſight, and with vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This opening is that we might ſee the enemy the more exactly; the ſteddineſs of ſight witneſſeth that the Soul is not aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and this vivacity comes from the arrival of the ſpirits which dart themſelves forth to combate it. And to ſpeak truth, it muſt have at leaſt theſe three conditions to form this kind of look. Moſt of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions makes us open our eyes to conſider
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47499:248"/>the good or ill which is their object, even Fear ſeems to be moſt careful of it, being moſt of all obliged to provide for her ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But it hath no ſet look being not able long to ſuffer the preſence of the enemy, the diſquiet ſhe is in rendring her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſtartled. A ſtrong meditation ſettles, the ſight but not with vivacity, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the ſpirits retreat towards their principles, and ſo leave a dimneſs in the eyes: Theſe three things therefore ought to meet to form the Look we ſpeak of; and he that will but obſerve it, will finde that the motion of the Eye-brows, the carriage of the Head, and the reſt of the Face con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomewhat thereunto.</p>
                        <p>However it be a Bold man looks upon danger with aſſurance,
<note place="margin">Why a Bold man ſhuts not his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids.</note> without winking, and this partly is from that the ſoul ſtiffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf in it ſelf, ſtiffens the Muſcles, and ſo hinders the lid from falling, and partly becauſe ſhe will not loſe the ſight of her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, nor ſo much as one minute inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the looks ſhe caſts on him. Moreover we may ſay ſhe hath not then ſo much need of winking as before, having rendred them ſtronger by the quantity of ſpirits which ſhe ſent thither. For it's certain, that when theſe parts are ſtrongeſt, this motion is leaſt neceſſary, for which cauſe Birds of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47499:248"/>prey, and all other Creatures, which have a ſtrong ſight, wink ſeldomer then the reſt; as on the contrary, men whoſe ſight is weak wink at every moment. Moreover this motion of the lids moyſtens the eyes and cleanſeth them, and thereby preſerves their tranſparency and mobility; it's chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtinated to aſſwage and temper by an interpoſing obſcurity which it brings the ſplendor of the exterior, which continually beats on it. Now ſo it is, that thoſe who have a ſtrong ſight, can longer and more eaſily endure the light then others, and conſequently they are not obliged to cloſe their eye-lids ſo often. If it be therefore true, that Boldneſs ſends a great quantity of ſpirits to thoſe parts, and ſo renders them more ſtrong and vigorous; It muſt alſo at the ſame time diſpence with their winking ſo often as they did formerly. In fine, if weakneſs and fear cauſe them to fall, to cover and hide them from the ill which perſues them; Boldneſs which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends nothing, and ſees peril and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without aſtoniſhment needs not this vain precaution, nor to employ an unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able relief.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>thorow Look</hi> is alſo common to many of the Paſſions,
<note place="margin">Why he looks thorow.</note> and chiefly to Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Anger, and to Boldneſs; to form
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47499:249"/>it, the Face muſt have ſomewhat of ſevere, the Eyes muſt impetuouſly caſt themſelves towards the Enemy, and the Head muſt be ſomewhat turned on the other ſide. Now ſeverity is neceſſary, becauſe we may caſt our Eyes aſide without looking through, as it often happens in all thoſe Paſſions which purſue good and flie from ill; for Love, Deſire, and Fear at every moment caſt their Eyes aſide, becauſe ſeverity is wanting in ſome by reaſon of the pleaſure which they inſpire, and in the other by reaſon of the aſtoniſhment which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies them: In effect, Severity is a certain rude, pecuiſh ſtifneſs, which the preſence of ill imprints in the whole countenance, and which is onely to be found in theſe Paſſions which aſſault ill; foraſmuch as the Soul ſtiffens it ſelf onely in theſe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which we have ſpoken of; the Eyes impetuouſly caſt themſelves againſt the Enemy, becauſe the Soul having put it ſelf in a poſture of fighting, employs its looks as ſo many darts which ſhe intends to caſt on it, but at the ſame time it turns the Head another way to ſhew its averſion from it, that it fears it not, and that it diſdains to employ greater forces againſt it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we commonly uſe this kinde of look in threatnings, where by the minde, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47499:249"/>by words, without coming to handy-blows we ſeek to ſtop the ill, eſteeming it not ſtrong enough to need to be aſſaulted with its ſtrongeſt arms, in Indignation, and in other little Angers, whereto we intend not Vengance to all extremity, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Boldneſs, before we are come to blows, when we think to decide the combate by little skirmiſhes. It's true, that it often happens that a man who dares not aſſault a potent Foe, will look through him; but that is but to hide his weakneſs, and make him beleeve it is not for want of force that he aſſaults him not, but rather that is out of generoſity, and becauſe he eſteems him worthy of ſo great an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.</p>
                        <p>There are other kind of Looks which often happen in this Paſſion,
<note place="margin">Why he contracts and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Brows.</note> as thoſe which are urgent and unquiet, thoſe which are rude and furious; but the firſt proceed from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and from Impatience, whereof we have elſe-where ſpoken; others come from Anger and from Fury, which ſhall be examined in the Diſcourſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>Let's now come to <hi>the motion of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Brows.</hi> To find the cauſe, we muſt learn it from Phyſick, that Nature hath not given to the Fore-head a proper moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47499:250"/>for the muſcles which cauſe it to move belong to the Brows, which ought to be moveable for the preſervation of the Eyes, and to help them in their functions; ſo that the Front never moves but when the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows move. Now amongſt thoſe motions which they are capable of, there are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally which are commonly to be obſerved in Boldneſs and Anger; the one is to lift them up, and the other to ſtrengthen them; but its very hard to tell what the motive is which the Soul propoſeth it ſelf in every of them, nor of what uſe they might be in the Paſſions we have now ſpoken of; It's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that according to the order which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath preſcribed to thoſe parts, <hi>they lift themſelves up,</hi> that they may the more freely ſee the object which preſents it ſelf, either by enlarging the circle of the ſight, which reſtrains it ſelf when they abate themſelves, or that they ſerve to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the lids, which after a manner they draw after them: And they ſtrengthen themſelves to ſtrengthen the eyes, making as it were a rampire before them to ſtop thoſe things which might fall from on high, and to defend them from the light which comes from without; for that the obſcurity it cauſeth, tempers the ſplendor, gathers the ſpirits, and in purſuit renders
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47499:250"/>the ſight ſtronger and more exact. But if we conſider theſe motions in the Paſſions, the Soul indeed muſt propoſe other motives then theſe. For I grant that the preſence of ill obligeth it to ſeek all the liberty, and all the ſtrength of the eyes, the better to diſcover the enemy, and aſſault him the more rightly; yet there are encounters wherein theſe cares ſeem uſeleſs, or at leaſt where they are greater then they need to be, becauſe it often happens that we that move the Brows and the ſight, at ſuch things as never ſo little diſpleaſe us, and wherein its nothing neceſſary to bring the leaſt precaution. Let's therefore conclude, that the diſturbance and the blindneſs which the Paſſions caſt in the Soul, divert it often from thoſe ordinary ways which Nature teacheth, which make her forget the true uſe for which thoſe organs were deſtinated, and purſued her, that what ought to ſerve her for one end may alſo be uſeful for another. So in all vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſhe brings water into the mouth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be only neceſſary in that of Food; ſo ſhe makes thoſe that are alone, laugh and ſpeak, although all thoſe actions are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Society, and Converſation. As therefore ſhe is accuſtomed to <hi>ſhrink up the Brows,</hi> to fortifie the ſight, and to defend
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47499:251"/>the Eyes againſt what might offend them, ſhe fancies ſhe ought do the ſame in the encounters of all kinde of Enemies; and by an error, like that of Creatures, which think they have hid all their Bodies when their Heads are covered; ſo ſhe thinks that fortifying her Eyes ſhe inſpires the ſame ſtrength in the other parts, and then all of them are in a condition to aſſault ill, having put that upon the defenſive. It's even ſo alſo, that ſhe raiſeth up the Brows, when ſhe raiſeth herſelf; for although that ſerves her the better to ſee the Enemy; yet ſhe fancies this elevation helps her riſing up, and that it ſo far advanceth the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her deſign, as to make the organs move ſo alſo. Yet we may obſerve that that which furthers this error is that the parts are extreamly moveable and obedient, and that they are in action ſooner then the Soul is aware of it. For the reſt which are more heavy, reſiſt theſe preparations, and require a greater deliberation to oblige them to ſtir.</p>
                        <p>We may yet add to this reaſon, that the Soul will often by theſe external motions manifeſt the ſtate and condition ſhe is in. So that ſhe raiſeth the Brows, to ſhew that ſhe raiſeth herſelf and ſhrinks them up, to witneſs that ſhe fortifies and gathers her
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47499:251"/>ſelf together; and this is the more likely, for that without being moved with thoſe agitations, ſhe forbears not alſo to make thoſe parts move when ſhe will diſſemble her weakneſs and her fear, and make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve ſhe hath a deſign to fight.</p>
                        <p>And now in purſuit of thoſe motions which are made by the orders of the Soul, the figure of the Fore-head neceſſarily changeth and altereth; for of neceſſity, when the Brows are lifted up, the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head muſt wrinckle,</hi> and when they ſhrink up, that muſt gather it ſelf betwixt the eyes; and then certainly if the skin be fleſhy, it makes, as it were, a great cloud in the midſt of the Forehead, which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> calls for the ſame reaſon <hi>Nebulous,</hi> which is proper and natural to Lions and to Bulls, and which is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſigns of the natural diſpoſition a man hath for Boldneſs, as elſewhere ſhall be ſaid.</p>
                        <p>When the hair ſtands on end,
<note place="margin">Why the hair ſtands on end.</note> it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the skin its rooted in, is moved; but this motion may be made two ways; for thoſe creatures which have a moveable and muſculous skin make it move when they pleaſe, and when they will aſſault or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, they ſhrink it up that they may render it ſtiffer and ſtronger, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47499:252"/>then neceſſarily thoſe plights and wrinkles which are formed muſt make the hair or feathers ſtare with which it's covered. It is not ſo with men, their skin being not muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, they cannot voluntarily move it, but onely out of neceſſity; and that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when the ſpirits with precipitation quit the outward parts of the Head, and flye away elſewhere. For the skin which is then forced to reſtrain and ſhut up it ſelf, makes the roots of the hair retire, which are commonly obliquely laid in the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the skin, and in reverting of it it makes the hairs riſe and ſtand on end. Commonly fear and aſtoniſhment cauſe this flight of the ſpirits; and which calling them back again to the Heart, render the Face pale, and makes the hair ſtand: But this is ſometimes alſo done by a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor of the Courage. For the Soul ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf preſſed by a puiſſant Enemy, gathers the ſpirits from all parts, in which its principal ſtrength conſiſts, and ſends them to the Arms, and ſo thoſe other parts which are appointed to aſſault and combate, ſo that thoſe which are abandoned of them grow pale, and the skin ſhrivels, and the hair ſtands on end, even as they do in fear. Now as Boldneſs and Anger one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can cauſe this endeavor, its onely they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47499:252"/>which are capable to produce this effect in the manner ſpoken of. But when that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, it's a ſign that thoſe Paſſions will riſe either to fury or deſpair; for which cauſe we commonly ſay that a Man that looks pale with Anger is terrible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soul never uſeth theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary means, but when ſhe is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſt, and when ſhe carries her ſelf away to her laſt violences. To conclude therefore this Diſcourſe, a Bold mans hair may ſtand upright, from the fear and from the aſtoniſhment which may ſometimes ſurpriſe him at the ſight of danger, or by the laſt effort of Courage, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Noſtrils open and widen themſelves,</hi> becauſe the heat growing ſtronger requires a greater reſpiration, and obligeth the ſoul therefore to enlarge the paſſages; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof thoſe who naturally have thoſe parts wide and open, are commonly bold and cholerick.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Smile</hi> comes from the indignation a man hath to ſee himſelf aſſaulted by a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous or inſolent enemy, or from our deſpiſing of his weak endeavors. But if we would know why theſe Paſſions cauſe theſe effects, we muſt ſee what hath been ſaid in the Diſcourſe of Laughter.</p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:47499:253"/>
                        <p>Silence is proper to true Boldneſs,
<note place="margin">Why he is ſilent.</note> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when its going into danger, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is then entirely gathered up in it ſelf to conſider the greatneſs thereof, or becauſe it diſdains to ſpeak to any body with whom it denies ſociety, either becauſe it hates or ſcorns them; or laſt of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it knows Words are arms of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with them Combates are not to be decided. And certainly, Boldneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds not in words, unleſs in ſuch who have their weakneſſes, for the Soul which knows its defect, uſeth all thoſe means which may releive her, and employs beſides thoſe endeavors which ſhe makes, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, cryings out, and reaſons to fright the enemy, and hide her own imbecillity; ſuch is the Boldneſs of Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſuch is that of Bragadocio's: And this Maxime is ſo general, that even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Beaſts we ſee that little Dogs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bark, when Maſtiffs and great ones, which are bigger and taller ſeldom bark, and are readier to fall on then we are awares. A man that is truly Bold doth the like; he is ſilent when he ſees the enemy, he goes towards him, and aſſaults him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word; but it's a threatning Silence, and which better expreſſeth his deſire he hath to fight, and the confidence
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47499:253"/>he hath in his forces, then even words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Yet this hinders not,
<note place="margin">What the voice of a Bold man is.</note> but that in the heat of the Combate from time to time, ſome <hi>flaſhes of his Voice, ſhort and piercing,</hi> may eſcape him, which commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the blows he gives, or the ſteps he takes; and this in my opinion is to aſtoniſh the enemy by thoſe exclamations which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark Ardor and Courage; or to animate and provoke himſelf, his cryings out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the ſame effect with that of the ſound of Trumpets; Or rather this comes from the endeavors and ſtruggles which the parts make within; which with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity driving the air to the Lungs, force it at its iſſuing out to reſound again, and to form <hi>a ſtrong and penetrating ſound,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its driven out with violence; <hi>Great,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the paſſages are inlarged by heat; and <hi>ſhort,</hi> becauſe it's made by ſallies and ſhocks; it ſeems even as if it iſſued not with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as if the lips and the teeth ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it in its paſſage would force it to return and retort it on himſelf, and to ſeek other paſſages, in which it's inwardly heard to reſound. This appears in the howlings of Maſtiffs and Blood-Hounds, in the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lions; for all of theſe caſt onely forth a great ſound, of a ſhort and reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47499:254"/>voice, which loſeth it ſelf in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Throat and Breaſt, and which they do not redouble but by long intervals, by reaſon that the Soul which truſts its ſtrengths, thinks not it ought to double its ſhocks with that eagerneſs which always accompanies weakneſs. The voice of a Bold man is then conſtrained, diſturbed, and as it were entangled in it ſelf, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:47499:254"/>
                        <p>But why doth he <hi>keep in his breath?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Why he keeps in his breath.</note> Doubtleſs to fortifie the motion of the other parts; for that we commonly never employ this action, but when we intend to give a great blow to do ſome other great endeavour. The reaſon of this Effect is drawn from the nature of the Motion, which is to be on ſome ſtable thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body moving upholds it ſelf. It's thus that Beaſts move, that Birds flie, and that Fiſh ſwim, and that all other things move; for in all theſe motions, the Earth, the Air and the Water, or ſome other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remains firm, and reſiſts the thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated; and in proportion as the reſiſtance and firmneſs is greater, the motion alſo is greater and ſtronger. Now as the parts of Animals lean more the one upon the other, when any of them is to perform any power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motion, it's neceſſary the reſt keep cloſe and even to the furthermoſt which contribute thereunto. It muſt finde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it ſelf ſomewhat which may ſuſtain it ſelf; otherwiſe the motion of the firſt of theſe will be weak, and their actions will be the leſs perfect. Whence it comes that Birds are troubled to flye when their Legs are broken; that we run not ſo well when our Hands are tied, and leap but ill unleſs we ſtiffen our Arms, and ſhut our Fiſts;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47499:255"/>becauſe thoſe parts in the condition they then are cannot uphold, as they ought to do the motions of the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The Soul then which hath a ſecret know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all what is beneficial unto her, and who knows that in violent endeavors there muſt be a great and ſtrong ſupport for thoſe organs which are to move, <hi>retains the Breath,</hi> that that air which is ſtopped in the Lungs may keep up the Muſcles of reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that preſſing them on all ſides, ſhe ſtiffens them to ſupport the reſt which are engaged in the action. So that we are not content onely to ſtop the breath, but we drive it, and cauſe it to deſcend down that the diaphragma may dilate it ſelf, and preſs the neighboring parts which thereby are rendred more fit to ſupport thoſe which are in motion.</p>
                        <p>In purſuit <hi>he ſhuts his Lips and his Tteeh,</hi> as well the better to ſtop the paſſages of reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as to confirm the parts, whether it be that their confirmation truly contributes to the great deſigns we have ſpoken of, or whether the Soul is abuſed in the choice ſhe makes, as being uſeleſs; as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in divers other occaſions, wherein ſhe is hindered by Paſſion to diſcern things, and to remember the true uſe of the organs.</p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:47499:255"/>
                        <p>That <hi>Coldneſs</hi> which is obſerved in the beginnings of Boldneſs,
<note place="margin">Whence comes the coldneſs of the Face.</note> is nothing but a certain conſtancy and aſſurance of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which is not aſtoniſhed at the ſight of danger, and which alſo witneſſeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ardor nor impatience to fight. And it hath been ſo called, becauſe that beſides that, it is the property of cold to render things immoveable; defect of heat is commonly called Coldneſs. Now this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and outward aſſurance comes from that which is made in the Soul and in the Spirits, and which retaining the humors and the parts in the poſture ſhe findes them in, hinders the blood from retiring or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding it ſelf, and the organs from move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For in this condition the countenance muſt not change colour, muſt remain firm and ſettled, muſt appear cold and reſolute at the encounter of difficulties: But the firſt cauſe of all theſe effects, is, that at that time the Soul raiſeth it ſelf not yet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy, onely prepares herſelf for the combate, as hath been ſaid; for when ſhe aſſaults him, the Spirits muſt riſe up with her, muſt carry blood and redreſs to the face, and fill all with vivacity, ardor, and impatience.

                        </p>
                        <p>This Coldneſs is followed with a <hi>noble fierceneſs,</hi> which animates the countenance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47499:256"/>of a Bold man chiefly when he goes into danger; for it appears not commonly in the firſt motions of Boldneſs, nor in the heat of fight, but onely when he is ready for the aſſault, and marcheth towards the Enemy: So that it ſeems it is as a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his ſtaiedneſs at firſt, and that ardor which tranſports him at laſt.</p>
                        <p>In effect, as this Fierceneſs is a kind of ſevere and diſdainful Pride, which comes from the preſumption and ſcorn which Boldneſs uſeth to inſpire: The Soul cannot be ſuſceptible of it before ſhe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a great opinion of her own ſtrength, becauſe that is the ground of her Pride, nor after ſhe hath found any ſtrong reſiſtance, becauſe that makes her perceive the danger greater then ſhe fancied it, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ought not to ſlight it. It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely when ſhe is ready to fight, for then ſhe is full of the eſteem which ſhe hath of herſelf, and then ſhe diſdains the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whoſe forces ſhe hath not yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                        <p>However it be, the Head is then kept erect, and the Brow lifted up, the look quick, and full of aſſurance, the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſwell'd and double-gorged, and hath I know not what in it, that's rude and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful. Now all theſe are the effects and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47499:256"/>characters of Pride, as in its place ſhall be ſaid. For the Soul which in this Paſſion ſwells it ſelf, raiſeth up the Head, lifts up the Brows, and ſwels the Face, as if ſhe thought more room to enlarge her ſelf, or by thoſe exterior motions ſhe would make that appear which ſhe hath in herſelf. An aſſured look comes from that conſidence which accompanies its Pride, and that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and diſdainful countenance from the indignation ſhe hath to finde obſtacles in her deſigns.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Poſture and the Gate</hi> contribute alſo to this Fierceneſs; for all the Body keeps it ſelf ſtreight and ſet, and if he ſtir, his march is haughty and proud. The Stature <hi>erects it ſelf,</hi> becauſe the Soul raiſeth and ſtiffens it ſelf, in the deſign which ſhe hath to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, which puts the Body into ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as is moſt advantagious for it to act, as we ſaid in the Diſcourſe of Hope.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>proud Gate,</hi> its that which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> calls Magnifick, which is natural to Lions, and is a ſign of ſtrength and of greatneſs of Courage. It's performed with great and grave paces, balancing the Body on either ſide, and at every ſtep lifting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forewards the Shoulders. But how difficult ſoever it be to expreſs this action to the life, its yet harder to finde
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47499:257"/>the true cauſe thereof. Some have ſought it in the ſame temperature which renders the Body robuſtious, and have ſaid that conſtitution being more firm and ſolid, their parts alſo were more united and ſhut together, and ſo they communicated the motion wherewith they were agitated to one another, and in purſuit that when the Legs did lift themſelves up, and advance to go, the Shoulders muſt be moved in the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>Of a truth, if all thoſe who were of that temper walked after that manner, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition would be ſomewhat probable. But beſides that all thoſe who are robuſtious walk not ſo: There are thoſe which are not ſo, to whom this gate is natural, or at leaſt who in ſome occaſions uſe it, as in Boldneſs, in Pride, and the like. We muſt then refer this effect to a more general cauſe, which muſt not be conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable as the temperature is, but changeth according to its encounters. And truly if it be a Character proper to Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it muſt proceed from the agitation of the Soul, whether it ſerve its deſign, or be done out of neceſſity. Now he that will conſider that the Soul which will board the enemy, ſtiffens herſelf to fortifie herſelf, and begins to raiſe herſelf, as to make trial of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47499:257"/>the aſſault ſhe is going about, will judge for the reaſons which we have ſo often allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that ſhe ought to inſpire the ſame motions into the organs, and conſequently that ſhe ſtiffens them, and drives them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly: So that the march and the other actions of the Body muſt ſuffer ſome change and muſt be performed after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then they were wont to be, by reaſon of that new and extraordinary impreſſion which they receive: A man then which is animated with Boldneſs, marcheth with a ſtiffer and more vigorous pace, having a greater number of Muſcles which ſtiffen it, and that all his body weighs and reſts it ſelf on that foot which upholds it: So that he the more ſtrongly treads the ground when he walks, wherein the ſtedineſs of the things ſupported conſiſts; and becauſe he cannot ſo readily diſplace that foot which ſtands ſtrong under ſo great a burthen, of neceſſity his pace muſt be ſlow, and he muſt go the more heavily. But this ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is recompenced by the greatneſs and largeneſs of his ſteps, his ſtrength ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſire he had to get to his Enemy, mixing, if we may ſo ſay, haſte with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: In purſuit of thoſe motions, the Shoulders are moved and ſtirred, as we
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47499:258"/>have ſaid; Becauſe all the Body ſtiffening it ſelf, and laying all the weight on the foot, it muſt needs be that changing place, and carrying the ſame burthen to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Shoulder muſt advance and weigh down it ſelf on the ſame ſide; and this being done with vigor, the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of the motion cauſeth it to turn ſomewhat inwardly, and paſſing ſo from the one to the other it ballanceth all the body in marching. Thus then Boldneſs uſeth this kinde of gate, ſo that if it be natural and ordinary, in ſome it's a ſign of greatneſs of Courage, becauſe the Soul which hath a ſecret knowledge of the motions it ought to make by inſtinct, bears it ſelf to this kinde of pace, which is proper to Boldneſs and to Generoſity, and marching without minding it, as if ſhe ought alwayes to affront the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore,
<note place="margin">Why he ſtoops his Head when he aſſaults.</note> when a Bold man is near danger, and upon the point of aſſaulting his adverſary, he ſtooping his Head, throws himſelf on him, whether he thinks he ſhould therewith knock againſt him, or that his deſire of fighting makes him advance that part, as it doth the reſt of them; Or that ſtiffening the Arms to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47499:258"/>ſtrike, the Neck muſt ſtiffen it ſelf to ſupport the endeavor of that motion, and in purſuit the Muſcles ſhorten themſelves and ſo cauſe the Head to ſtoop, or in fine, becauſe it would cover it ſelf, and not give aim to the enemies blows; for this reaſon it is that he bows all his Body, that he gathers himſelf up, that he contracts himſelf, and puts himſelf on his guard, to uſe the terms of Art.</p>
                        <p>In the heat of the Combate, <hi>His Face is inflamed, his Eyes become ardent, and his ſweat runs from all parts;</hi> Foraſmuch as the ſpirits and the humors caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves impetuouſly to the outward parts, and that the heat which the Soul ſtirs up in this encounter, expands it ſelf every way, diſſolves the humors, and cauſeth them to run through the pores which ſhe keeps open. It's thus, That in great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, we have often ſeen blood ſtartle out of the Eyes, Lips, and other parts, and ſometimes even from all the Body, in form of ſweat. But when this laſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, the tranſport of the Soul muſt be exceſſive. For ſhe muſt be much urged and conſtrained to do a very extraordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor after this manner to drive out of the veins this treaſure of life.</p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:47499:259"/>
                        <p>He <hi>beats the earth with his feet,</hi> to make his Force and vigor appear, and to aſtoniſh the enemy by the noiſe and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt which at once his Foot, his Voice and his blows make.</p>
                        <p>He <hi>darts himſelf forth,</hi> and leaps light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his forces being augmented by heat, and by the motion of the ſpirits which render him lighter and better diſpoſed.</p>
                        <p>His <hi>reſpiration is ſtrong and impetuous,</hi> becauſe heat is encreaſed, which augments the force of the vital parts, and requires a greater refreſhment, for which cauſe the Breaſt and the Lungs extend and enlarge themſelves the more to attract the greater quantity of freſh air, and they fall with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, the more readily to drive away the fumes which the boiling of the ſpirits and the humor excite.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Pulſe is great, high, quick, frequent and vehement,</hi> for the ſame reaſons; for the Arteries open and extend themſelves very much, that they may receive the more air for the refreſhing of the ſpirits; and as this opening ſatisfies not yet the need which preſſeth the Heart, the Soul adds to the greatneſs of its motion, ſwiftneſs, and frequency, the more readily to attract re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and the oftner to diſcharge thoſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47499:259"/>fumes which heat raiſeth up. To conclude, Becauſe ſhe gathers together her forces to aſſault and combate ill, we need not doubt but the vital Faculty grows ſtronger, but that ſhe more powerfully moves her organs, and that conſequently ſhe makes the Pulſe more ſtrong and vehement. It's true, that all theſe divers beatings of it are alſo in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but when we ſpeak of that Paſſion, we will ſhew the difference ſhe makes therein; Let's go to more pleaſing ſubjects which hither to have been obſerved by no man, or at leaſt which our ordinary Philoſophy hath not yet examined.</p>

                        <p>IF it be true that Boldneſs hath no other function but to aſſault and combate;
<note place="margin">Conſtancy is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from Boldneſs.</note> yet is the Soul often obliged to labour in its own defence, and ſimply to reſiſt thoſe ills without daring to aſſault them; there muſt neceſſarily therefore be a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which muſt ſerve it in this encounter, and muſt be different from Boldneſs. And truly fince Paſſions are motions, there muſt be ſeveral Paſſions where there is a diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of motion. Now the motion which the Soul makes in reſiſting, is altogether different from that which ſhe makes in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting, whether it be in the manner wherewith it's agitated, or in the end which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47499:260"/>ſhe hath propoſed to herſelf. For in reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhe knows nothing but how to ſtiffen and ſtreng then herſelf in herſelf to ſtop the effort of the Enemy. But in aſſault ſhe goes out of herſelf, and caſts herſelf on it to combate it; here ſhe darts and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates herſelf, there ſhe ſtays and remains ſtable; here ſhe boldly beſtows the blow, there ſhe receives them with aſſurance. In a word, in the one ſhe would overcome, in the other ſhe is content not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                        <p>But if this Reaſon will not oblige us to diſtinguiſh theſe Paſſions which Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy hath always confounded, let's but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the common opinion of men, and the ordinary way of ſpeaking in ſuch like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters; For they never ſay, That a man with Boldneſs bears his ill fortune; nor that he ſuffers Infamy, Grief or Death boldly, but that he endures them, that he ſuffers with Courage, with Reſolution, with Conſtancy and with Patience.</p>
                        <p>If it be not Boldneſs therefore which produceth theſe effects, and if amongſt the Paſſions mentioned by the Schools, there is none whereto we can refer them, we are conſtrained to encreaſe the number of them, and to add to the emotions of the Iraſcible Appetite, that which ſerves
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47499:261"/>to ſupport ills, and to reſiſt them.</p>
                        <p>Now as thoſe who diſcover a new Land, commonly give it the name of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which are beſt known unto them, and which have ſome likeneſs together: We have by their example taken the liberty to give this Paſſion the name of Conſtancy, a vertue known to all the world, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it hath a great conformity.</p>
                        <p>And truly there are Paſſions which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carry the name of Vices, becauſe they always appear to be vitious, as Envy and Impudence. It muſt follow, that thoſe which always appear vertuous, ſhould alſo bear the name of Vertues. Now this is of this kinde; for in what condition ſoever we finde her, what defects ſoever ſhe hath, we ſtill ſee ſome image of Vertue in her. And even when ſhe is altogether irregular, we are forced to admire her, and to afford her thoſe praiſes which are due to fair acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; let's boldly therefore give her the name of Conſtancy, ſince ſhe is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of thoſe advantages which are due unto Vertue.</p>
                        <p>But if any man would object, That what we call Paſſion is nothing but the action of that Vertue; and therefore that it is nothing neceſſary to introduce a new Paſſion, ſince the actions of Vertues are not properly Paſſions.</p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:47499:261"/>
                        <p>We muſt firſt ſay, That all the actions of Conſtancy cannot be reckoned for actions of Vertue, ſince ſome of them may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as when we reſiſt ills, which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily we ſhould flie, or when we do not reſiſt them as we ought, nor when we ought, nor for that end which Vertue hath propoſed to it ſelf. Moreover an action of Conſtancy may be performed without poſſeſſing of the Vertue; foraſmuch as Vertue is a habit which is gotten by cuſtom, and that there is no habit acquired till we perform the firſt actions of Conſtancy. Now if there are but three things in the Soul, Power, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and Paſſion, this firſt action muſt be a Paſſion, ſince it is neither a Power nor an Habit, as it is eaſie to be judged. In fine, If Conſtancy is a Vertue, it muſt needs have a Paſſion which ſerves for its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and which makes, if we may ſo ſpeak, the body and the ſubſtance of this action; for Vertue, to ſpeak properly, is but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and a rule which Reaſon gives to the actions and motions of the Soul: So that we muſt ſuppoſe motions before they can be regulated; and theſe Motions are Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which for that cauſe are called the ſubſtance of Vertues. Conſtancy being then a Vertue, ought to have a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to work upon, which is no other but
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47499:262"/>that which we have ſpoken of, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons already declared.</p>
                        <p>Now although we ought not to think it ſtrange that both of them bear the ſame name, ſince the word Boldneſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to the Paſſion and to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; yet if after all theſe reaſons any ſhall think its to prophane the name of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to aſſign it to a Paſſion, I will not oppoſe him; he may if he pleaſe chuſe that of Strength of Courage, becauſe the Soul ſtiffens it ſelf to reſiſt the ill which aſſaults it, as ſhall be ſeen in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Let's therefore no longer ſtop at words, but examine the things in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we have propoſed.</p>
                        <p>You muſt not think to meet here with an inſolent and an ambitious Paſſion which like Love or Boldneſs would be Queen and Miſtris of the reſt.
<note place="margin">The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</note> She is too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to uſe flatteries and baſeneſs, which the one employs to eſtabliſh its power; and ſhe is too modeſt to ſubject her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by force and violence as Boldneſs doth; what advantage ſoever ſhe hath over them, ſhe yeelds them the precedence without pretending to command, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents her ſelf not to obey them. And without marching at the head of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it's ſufficient for her to be a follower of the Vertues.</p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:47499:262"/>
                        <p>In effect, it's ſhe which maintains and preſerves them, it's ſhe which makes them overcome, and which crowns them; and he who would more nearly examine what ſhe doth for them, might boldly ſay, that if ſhe brings them not forth, yet at leaſt ſhe accompliſheth them, and renders them worthy of the names they bear, and of the recompence they expect; and truly a vertue which yeelds and keeps not firm, which gives up its arms after the firſt fight, or flies after the victory, is an imperfect Vertue. And the perfection which it wants can be added unto it by nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, which alone can conſummate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced vertues, and make them deſerve the glory they aſpire unto.</p>
                        <p>But I ſay further, that to examine them from their birth, we may ſee that they wholly owe it unto her, and that after rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath conceived them, it's ſhe that brings them forth, which makes them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and makes them ſubſiſt. For it's certain, that what ſervice ſoever Vertue draws from the Paſſions, they are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies which reſiſt her; they alone form thoſe difficulties which croſs her, and it's none but they which are capable to ſtifle her when ſhe comes to light, and to deſtroy her when ſhe is in her greateſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47499:263"/>ſtrength. Without doubt, were there no Paſſions, Vertue would appear in the Soul like a pure light which would have neither vapors nor clouds to overcome. It would be a Star which would direct its courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards good without any let, and which would conduct us to felicity without trouble or diſquiet. We ſhould no longer ſpeak of thoſe vices and crimes, but as of ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as were invented by Fables; and all that great croud of ills, which at every moment diſturbs the tranquillity of life, would be unknown or impotent; at leaſt if it yet cauſed any diſorders, we ſhould not reſcent them, ſince it's Fear and Grief onely which render them ſenſible.</p>
                        <p>But as it's a neceſſity impoſed on Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to be born and dwell with its enemies; we muſt alſo confeſs that if any thing can defend it from their violence, and ſtop thoſe endeavors whereby they ſeek to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; certainly, it's ſhe alone to whom it's obliged both for its birth and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to whom its obliged for all the good which happens unto it. Now it's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy alone which deſerves this glory, ſince it's ſhe onely that is capable of reſiſting the Paſſions, ſtopping thoſe paſſages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might enter upon the Soul, and which diſſipateth them after they are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in.</p>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:47499:263"/>
                        <p>And truly its herein we are to admire the providence of Nature, who in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral revolt wherein ſhe ſees all theſe ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have engaged themſelves againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, doth like a wiſe Politian, who caſts diviſion amongſt the Rebells, who gains the moſt powerful, and makes uſe of their forces to deſtroy their own Confederates: For ſhe makes Conſtancy quit the party of the rebellion, and inſpires her with that noble perfidiouſneſs, which cauſeth her to betray her Complices; in a word, ſhe arms one Paſſion againſt all the Paſſions, againſt all Vices, and againſt all ills; and this was the onely expedient to yeeld unto Reaſon that Empire which belonged unto it, and to bring it to the enjoyment of thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and of that Felicity which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined unto: For being ſhe could perform no action without the help of the Paſſions, had ſhe been abandoned of them all, ſhe muſt have remained always idle; and it was neceſſary that ſome one of them ſhould be faithful upon this occaſion, and that it ought to ſuccour it in a deſign wherein it meets with ſuch great obſtacles and ſuch powerful adverſaries. Now it will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing difficult to perſwade that ſhe whom we have ſpoken of, is onely one reſponſible in this expectation, if we conſider that all
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47499:264"/>her nature and eſſence conſiſts in that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which the Soul gives herſelf; and that even as water ſtops and loſeth its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it freezeth, ſo alſo when the Soul ſettles it ſelf, and that all its motions ceaſe, that thoſe Paſſions wherewith ſhe was agitated, diſſipate themſelves, and the ills which aſſaulted her can no longer make any impreſſion on her.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, ſhe is in the condition of a rock which remains immoveable againſt the violence of the winds, waves and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts; ſhe cannot then be moved, neither by the impetuoſity of deſire, nor by the over-ſlowings of luſts, nor with the ſtorms of Fortune. She hath an impenetrable Hardneſs againſt ſcorn, againſt offences, and againſt injuries; and although ſhe is aſſaulted with ſickneſs and grief, we may ſay that they are floods which indeed by degrees undermine the ſhoar, but which can never overturn her, nor make her change place.</p>
                        <p>So that theſe advantages being not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe which accompany Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we muſt neceſſarily confeſs, that Conſtancy is this ſame Wiſdom, or that it is its general and inſeparable inſtrument; and that amongſt the Paſſions ſome are common to all Creatures, others proper to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47499:264"/>Men, but that this is onely peculiar to the Wiſe; for it's ſhe hath formed all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of Antiquity, which in all Ages hath produced ſo many wonderful examples of Fidelity, of Temperance, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Courage; which hath made Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion triumph over Vices and Tyrants. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, which hath made the Vertues reign on Earth, and which hath crowned them in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Yet we muſt confeſs that ſhe owes all the glory of theſe fair actions to the councels of Reaſon; and were ſhe not enlightened with its light, ſhe would continue in that blindneſs wherein all the reſt of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are born, and caſt the Soul into thoſe precipices whereunto her own evill inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions commonly move her: When this wiſe Guide indeed forſakes her, ſhe takes part with Vices and Crimes, and renders them the ſame ſervice ſhe is obliged to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Vertues; for ſhe upholds them, and ſtrengthens them, ſhe compleats and conſummates their malice; and all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they have is but an effect of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy perſeverance which ſhe affords their ill deſigns. Its ſhe that locks up the Heart from all the perſwaſions of Prudence, from all the warnings of Heaven, from all the ſentiments of Nature, which hardens it, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47499:265"/>renders it immoveable againſt all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, and inſpiring it with opinionacy in its reſolutions, with Hardneſs of heart towards the miſeries of others, and with Obſtinacy in all ill, it renders a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of civil ſociety, and an enemy to God, to men and to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>But we need ſay no more of it, nor by a long invective diſhonor a Paſſion which is ſo uſeful and neceſſary to Wiſdom, and which hath cauſed no diſorders in the World but through the ill uſe which men have made thereof. Let's purſue our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and content our ſelves here to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoſe Characters which ſhe uſeth to imprint in the Soul, and on the Body of thoſe who are ſenſible of it.</p>
                        <p>Although at firſt this deſign ought to be neither long nor difficult in the execution,
<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant man</note> and that this Paſſion making no change of countenance, and being not ſuſceptible of that variety which is obſervable in the reſt, ſo that we need but one figure, and as we may ſay but one ſimple touch to draw this Picture; yet beſides that it's difficult to expreſs any motion, and that that is one of the moſt ſecret and moſt hid which is in the Soul: There are ſo many other things which are to be brought into the piece, that it's impoſſible but the work muſt be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47499:265"/>greater and more painful then any man could think. In effect, we muſt here repreſent ſhipwracks and precipices, poverty, exile, and ſlavery; the loſs of honor, of parents, of Friends; all what grief, and the moſt violent ſickneſſes; all what tortures, and the moſt cruel torments; all what deſpair and death have that is frightful and moſt hideous; and what is yet more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, all what the charmes of Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Ambition have of moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving: For to conclude, theſe are the principal enemies which arm themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conſtancy, which aſſault it and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to overcome it.</p>
                        <p>Let's therefore fancy a man animated with this Paſſion, and ſee what ſentiments he may have at the approach of ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful adverſaries. Certainly, it's in theſe encounters that the Soul forms its moſt noble deſigns, and takes the moſt generous reſolutions which it is capable of; every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe where ſhe expects and affronts ill, ſhe thinks to be ſtronger and more powerful then it, ſhe ſtill hopes for the Victory, and never fights, but ſhe is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by ſome ſtronger forces; but here ſhe hath an enemy in front who appears invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, whom ſhe dare not aſſault, and againſt whom ſhe alone muſt reſiſt, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other help.</p>

                        <p>In the mean time, ſhe ſees him come without fear, and without aſtoniſhment; ſhe conſiders him without trouble and without diſquiet, and if ſhe pretend not to conquer him, ſhe at leaſt aſſures herſelf that ſhe ſhall not be overcome; as knowing that the ſtrongeſt waves break themſelves againſt the rocks, and that the banks hinder the overflowings of the moſt impetuous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; ſhe promiſeth herſelf the ſame ſucceſs from her reſiſtance, and believes that the ſtrength of her Courage will break off the violence of the ills, and ſtop the courſe of all thoſe miſchiefs which come pouring upon her. In her opinion there is no effort ſtrong enough to make her yield; all the Elements would change place, without making her change her ſtation; and were it poſſible the maſs of the Heavens ſhould break, ſhe imagines that ſhe could ſuſtain its ruines without being over-turned.</p>
                        <p>But what is more wonderful, is, that ſhe often miſtruſts her forces, and ſees well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that her reſiſtance will be uſeleſs, and her loſs inevitable. Neither is this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to make her change her reſolution; although even ſhe might eſcape the danger by flight, ſhe remains firm and expects the ſhock of the enemy, with the ſame tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and with the ſame confidence, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47499:266"/>if ſhe were ſure of the Victory. She alſo believes that a man is never overcome, if he loſeth not his heart, if he delivers not up his arms; that yielding to force, we yield not to honor of the Battel; and that in that of Conſtancy, we have always this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, To triumph over the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                        <p>She in purſuit hereof repreſents to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the glory which ſo many great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages have acquired in torments and in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; the Crowns which they have deſerved in the moſt difficult proofs of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and the immortal renown of ſuch fair examples, make her hope, if ſhe can but conſtantly ſuffer the ills which threaten her; with this thought ſhe encourageth her ſelf, and without hearing thoſe reaſons which might make her yield, ſhe puts her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a condition to receive the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and vigorouſly to maintain his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.</p>
                        <p>Behold her now grappling with him; behold her either aſſaulted with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of grief, or by the outrages of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or by the darts of Calumny: as if ſhe were inſenſible of all their blows, ſhe neither troubles herſelf to flie from them, or to repel them; and although ſhe be cruelly wounded by them, ſhe ſuffers not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47499:267"/>ſo much as a complaint nor a threat to come from her, which might make the leaſt reſentment of hers appear. She ſees her body torn with tortures or with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if it did not truly belong unto her, or in effect, were but her Garment: She conſiders the loſs of her Goods as a debt ſhe repays Fortune, and thinks that an injury is ill onely in the opinion of him that ſuffers it, and can truly offend onely him that doth it.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt by theſe reaſons ſhe ſeeks to ſweeten her ills, they forbear not inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perplex her with freſh pangs, which ſometimes are ſo violent that ſhe cannot ſave the Body from ſuccumbing under their violence, and from betraying its ſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by its weakneſs, and by that languor which appals it. But for her own part, inſtead of growing weaker ſhe becomes more ſtrong and vigorous; and as the earth ſtrengthens it ſelf, when its beaten, we may ſay, that the blows of grief harden her and render her impenetrable againſt all its attaints; Grief it ſelf, which ſeems to be the inſeparable companion of adverſity and misfortune, cannot reach her; at leaſt it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver riſeth to that high Region where ſhe forms her deſigns, and where ſhe entertains a calm and a continual ſerenity. It's from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47499:267"/>thence ſhe ſecurely beholds the ſtorms and the tempeſts which agitate the inferior parts, the troubles and ſufferings whereof ſhe with pleaſure often conſiders and ſheds abroad a chearfulneſs in the complaints and tears which the rigor of her ill often extorts from her Mouth and Eyes.</p>
                        <p>And truly there is cauſe of aſtoniſhment to ſee her ſo calm in the midſt of chains and fire, in the midſt of publick deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the midſt of ſo many things, the thought of which alone produceth horror and terror; but that in theſe encounters ſhe ſhould witneſs joy, that ſhe ſhould bleſs her perſecutors, and that ſhe ſhould ſpeak her pains to be pleaſing and glorious, it's a thing which ſeems to combate Reaſon and Nature, and which is almoſt uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable: We muſt alſo confeſs that this is the laſt effort of Conſtancy, and that ſhe then ought to be upheld by ſome great and noble Paſſion, to produce ſome great and wonderful effect: For commonly griefs and misfortunes uſe to convey into the ſtrongeſt and moſt reſolute Soul I know not what kinde of bitterneſs which renders it pecuiſh and wary, which at every inſtant forceth from it ſome ſecret complaints, and at length bereaves it of its ſtrength, at leaſt of that ardor and vivacity which it had at firſt.</p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:47499:268"/>
                        <p>It's then there that the Soul employs Conſtancy againſt Adverſaries: It's thus ſhe defends herſelf from thoſe ills which aſſault her with open force. Let's now ſee what ſhe doth againſt thoſe which under the appearance of good ſeek to ſeduce her, which to betray her, flatter her; and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome her, uſe no other violence but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of enticements and charms. I mean Voluptuouſneſs and Ambition, and all thoſe unjuſt deſires which continually preſent themſelves unto her, which at every moment provoke and ſollicite her, and which are the more to be feared, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces keeping intelligence with them, and foraſmuch as they promiſe felicity to thoſe who ſuffer themſelves to be overcome by their allurements.</p>
                        <p>We muſt certainly confeſs that ſhe uſeth no other arms to defend herſelf againſt ſuch dangerous enemies, but onely thoſe which Conſtancy in theſe encounters affords her; ſhe knows that to render their plots and their forces uſeleſs, ſhe needs onely to keep herſelf ſtiff and firm; and that in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhe cannot be mollified with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, nor lifted up with the winde of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, nor carried away by the hope of thoſe goods which ſhe hath not; ſhe knows that Pleaſure is ever accompanied with Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47499:268"/>that Ambition never walks but on precipices, and that Deſire is not ſo much a ſign as it is the cauſe of Poverty. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſhe knows that all the contentment, and all the good fortune which thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers promiſe are but impoiſoned ſweets which corrupt Health and Reaſon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the quiet of the Mind, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Life.</p>
                        <p>On ſuch like Reaſons being reſolved to hold out againſt them, ſhe puts herſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her guard, and ſhuts up all the avenues by which they might ſurpriſe her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſhe turns her eyes from the moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects; ſhe ſhuts her ears to the moſt charming words and perſwaſions; ſhe flies the approach of all thoſe things which might tickle or ſeduce the ſence; For it's certain, that ſhe expects not ſuch kinde of enemies in a ſtedfaſt poſture, and that ſhe receives them not chearfully, as ſhe doth the reſt. She commonly defends herſelf from theſe by a wiſe retreat; and when ſhe cannot ſhun their encounter, ſhe puts on a certain diſdainful ſeverity, which checks them, and renders their careſſes vain, and their flatteries of no uſe. We may even ſay, that as there are things which inſtead of being molified, harden themſelves by heat, it ſeems that the ardor of theſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47499:269"/>Paſſions produceth the ſame effect in her, and that that pleaſure which melts and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quifies hearts, hardens hers. She becomes indeed as if ſhe were ſtupid towards all thoſe things which are the moſt deſirable, and the moſt delicious in the world; the charms of Beauty, the ſplendor of Riches, move her not; Praiſe and Glory have no allurements for her; but quite contrary to that unhappy man who is feigned to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with goods, which flye from him when he ſeeks to enjoy them, ſhe appears in the midſt of delights, which ſhe flies as ſoon as they become ſenſible. If it happen that the Sences betray her, and that unknown to her, they taſte the poyſon which they preſent them withal, ſhe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth them by the grief which ſhe cauſeth them to ſuffer; and for fear leaſt ſhe ſhould herſelf be infected, ſhe keeps herſelf pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiſh and auſtere, and takes a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt of all ſweets, and againſt all the entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Pleaſure. It's thus alſo that ſhe preſerves herſelf from that Pride and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity wherewith Proſperity is commonly puffed up, from the diſquiet and impatience which move violent deſires, from thoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guors and tranſports which follow irregular contentments. In fine it's thus, ſhe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains herſelf in ſo juſt a temper, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47499:269"/>her modeſt in good Fortune, ſevere in Pleaſure, content in Neceſſity, and every way equal and like herſelf. Theſe are the principal touches which Conſtancy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints in the Soul: we muſt now obſerve thoſe which ſhe makes on the Face and on the other parts of the Body. But we may at firſt ſay that they are ſo like thoſe which Boldneſs forms thereon, that did we know them no other ways but as two Siſter Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, we might eaſily by the likeneſs of their lineaments judge, that they are of the ſame family, or at leaſt that they both have the ſame inclinations.</p>
                        <p>For as ſoon as ill preſents it ſelf to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant man, he expects it with the ſame Eye, with the ſame Front, and in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as if he were ready to aſſault and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate it; his look is firm and aſſured, his Countenance changeth not colour, and without ſtirring his Brows or Lids, he coldly conſiders the danger which threatens him, and ſeems to brave with a reſolved mind the misfortune it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>You muſt not expect from him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of injuries, nor any of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations wherewith Fear and Anger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably beat the Air. Silence commonly ſhuts his mouth; and if he is obliged to ſpeak, its with a tone of Voice which remarks
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47499:270"/>the tranquillity of his Minde, and the ſtrength of his Courage; for his voice is neither weak nor vehement, ſlow nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, it is ſtrong, equal, and ſettled; and it's upheld with a certain majeſtical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent which mixeth reſpect and admiration with the fear we have to ſee him ſo near danger. He holds up his Head without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence; his port is noble without Pride; his pace is grave without Haughtineſs; and in all his actions there appears a generous coldneſs, and a modeſt confidence.</p>
                        <p>But it is not onely before the aſſault that he appears thus reſolved; he carries the ſame air and the ſame aſſurance into danger and into fight. When he is firſt preſt by the enemy, he ſtiffens his Nerves, he holds his Breath, and gathering himſelf up in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he confirms and ſettles himſelf in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. In this condition, without going back, he beats all aſſaults which are made againſt him; he feels fire and ſword fall on him without looking pale; he ſees his blood run from all parts without aſtoniſhment; and findes his Body wounded with wounds, and torn in pieces without complaining, and without ſo much as wrinkling his Brow. If ſometimes any man makes him change colour, caſt forth crys, or turn up his looks, it paſſeth ſo ſuddenly that we may eaſily
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47499:270"/>judge, that the violence of the ill ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him, and that it hath robbed from him, if we may ſo ſpeak, thoſe motions from his Conſtancy. For at the ſame time he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth his complaints and his ſighs; he devoureth his grief, and bringing back a calm in his Countenance with a ſmile, and with the ſweet looks of his eyes he doth not onely reprehend his firſt reſolve, but makes it appear more gay and better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. In fine, if he perceive the ſtrength of his Body forſake him, and that he muſt ſuccumb under the effort of the enemy which aſſaults him, in falling he makes it appear that his Courage is not caſt down; that by his fall he raiſeth up himſelf, and that it is not he that yields, but his ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                        <p>For he ſuffers all the inſolency of the Victor without murmuring or ſo much as moving. He ſees thoſe blows come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being frighted, which will be the loſs of his life, and he is already ſenſible of death, yet ſtill hath a care to compoſe his Countenance, and to leave on his dying body the remains of his Conſtancy.</p>
                        <p>But it's time to enquire the cauſe of all theſe effects; neither have we any thing more to ſay of thoſe Characters which this Paſſion imprints on the body, when ſhe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47499:271"/>reſiſts thoſe pleaſing and deceitful ills of which we have ſpoken, ſince ſhe adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to her ſettled Countenance but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, diſdain, and frowardneſs wherewith ſhe arms herſelf againſt their Allurements, and that we have already obſerved them in the firſt figures of this Picture. Let's now examine what its nature is, ſince its the ſource whence all theſe effects ought to take their original.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>ALthough at our enterance into this Diſcourſe,
<note place="margin">Why this Paſſion is neceſſary.</note> we have made the nature of this Paſſion appear, having been obliged to diſtinguiſh it from Boldneſs, to obſerve the difference of its motions, and the end which the Appetite propoſeth it ſelf; yet we muſt ſay that we have made therein but an imperfect draught wherein we have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly traced out the moſt remarkable parts, and the groſſeſt lineaments, and that now we muſt add the laſt touches, and thoſe colours which were wanting thereunto.</p>
                        <p>For which purpoſe we muſt again betake
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47499:271"/>our ſelves to thoſe principles which we have eſtabliſhed in the precedent Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſay, that Nature hath inſpired in every thing the care of its own preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having taught them to ſeek what is fit, and to flie what was hurtful, and to combate what was contrary to them; that the Soul as the moſt noble and the moſt excellent, hath this knowledge, and theſe inclinations moſt ſtrong and moſt perfect: And that all thoſe Paſſions wherewith ſhe is continually agitated; are the means ſhe uſeth to attain thoſe ends; ſome of them being appointed to purſue good, others to flie ill, and others to aſſault it; That in fine ſhe flies or aſſaults ills according as ſhe believes herſelf weaker or ſtronger then they; and that Fear, Timerouſneſs, and Deſpair are ſigns of Weakneſs; as Hope, Boldneſs and Anger are effects of Power.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe this diviſion is grounded on more and leſs, and that amongſt theſe two there is ever a middle, which is equality: It's not ſufficient to have ſhewn that the Soul is ſtronger and weaker then the Evil. We muſt yet add, that their forces may be equal; ſo that if ſhe ought to flie when ſhe is the weaker, and aſſault when ſhe is the ſtronger, of neceſſity when their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47499:272"/>ſtrengths are equal, and conſequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither to flie nor aſſault, ſhe muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſimply on the defenſive, and that without yeilding to the end eavors of the enemy, and without alſo undertaking any thing againſt him, ſhe muſt content her ſelf only to reſiſt. It muſt needs, I ſay, be, that as flying ſhe retires with precipitation, and that ſhe darts herſelf forth with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity when ſhe aſſaults, ſhe muſt alſo ſtop and keep herſelf ſtiff when ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends onely to reſiſt; and this ſtiffening having reſiſtance onely for its motive, and proceeding from the equality we have now ſpoken of, it muſt make all the Nature and Eſſence of this Paſſion, there being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which this motion in all circumſtances befits.</p>
                        <p>But before we examine more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the manner wherewith the Soul is then agitated,
<note place="margin">Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſhew that Conſtancy is formed with this equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſtrength.</note> we muſt clear a difficulty which ariſeth from thoſe propoſitions which we have eſtabliſhed; for there is great reaſon for us to doubt, That equality of forces ſhould be the principle of this Paſſion, ſince it's certain, ſhe often forms it when the Soul is ſtronger or weaker then thoſe ills which aſſault her. How many have we ſeen of thoſe noble Courages who have oppoſed enemies far more powerful then
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47499:272"/>themſelves, who have been firm and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in thoſe dangers, wherein their loſs was certain, and who have conſtantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the greateſt imaginable ills without hope, even without having a minde to ſhun them? On the contrary, is it not an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary effect of Magnanimity not to employ all ones forces againſt a weak enemy, and to oppoſe againſt him a mans own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, onely without fighting with him, or pretending to a Victory, whereby he might gain honor? The Soul then may be moved with Conſtancy at the encounter of theſe ills which ſhe eſteems weaker or ſtronger then herſelf; and therefore the foundation on which we thought to have ſo well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed this Paſſion, cannot ſuſtain it ſelf, and threatens the ruine of all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> To anſwer to ſuch ſtrong Objections,
we muſt firſt obſerve, that the opinion which the Soul hath of her forces is not eſſential to the Paſſions, but an action of Judgment, and not of the Appetite. And that it onely is inſtead of a natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards their production, in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral order which Nature hath preſcribed thoſe Powers; but foraſmuch as this order is often changed in particulars, it alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that when the Paſſions form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47499:273"/>this condition is often wanting as all other things which are ſtrangers to them, and enter not into their eſſence.</p>
                        <p>Now this general order will have the ſenſitive Appetite immediately conducted by the imagination, as by a light which is proper and neceſſary unto it, and deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſhew it all what it ought to do. And as ſhe would in vain propoſe unto it to do any thing, unleſs ſhe thought it were in its power, theſe forces muſt neceſſarily be known unto it, and ſhe muſt know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are great enough to oppoſe thoſe difficulties which preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>So that if the Faculties be not put out of that road which naturally they ought to keep, the Appetite could never form any motion, but the imagination muſt firſt have compared her ſtrength with the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; but that ſhe muſt have thought her ſelf ſtronger then them, when ſhe ordains them to combate them; but that ſhe muſt have believed ſhe was weaker when ſhe counſels us to flie them; and finally, but that ſhe muſt have judged that at leaſt her forces are equal with theirs, when ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth it to expect or to reſiſt them. For it ſometimes happens that ſhe thinks herſelf ſtronger, and yet ſhe will not aſſault, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47499:273"/>it be becauſe ſhe ſlights the enemies weakneſs, or becauſe natural Juſtice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids her to undertake too unequal a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, as hath been ſhewed in the Diſcourſe of Boldneſs. However it be, that order which we have now remarked is ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Beaſts, in whom theſe two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties abſolutely command, and are not hindered in their Functions by any ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Power which they are ſubject to. But it is not ſo with Man, in whom Reaſon and Will ought to govern the ſenſitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and cauſe it to move as it pleaſeth them; for it often happens that theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, without having reſpect to thoſe motives which the imagination propoſeth to the Appetite, oblige him to flie when he might aſſault or defend himſelf, and to fight and reſiſt when he ought to betake himſelf to flight: It is not but that Reaſon ſees that the Combate and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which ſhe cauſeth the inferior part to make, are uſelsſt to overcome thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, or to ſtop their courſe. But as unprofitable as they are for theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motives, they ſerve for others, which it judgeth more noble and more uſeful then thoſe. And the vain endeavors which it then moves in the Appetite, are the means which it employs to attain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47499:274"/>end. Thus ſhe often aſſaults an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when ſhe knows not very well who ſhall be overcome. But it's onely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire honor and glory wherewith generous actions are rewarded; ſhe ſuffers couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly grief, torments and death it ſelf, not to avoid the effect which ſhe believes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, but to merit thoſe Crowns which Heaven and Earth give unto Conſtancy. In a word, there are divers motives which may engage her in thoſe deſigns, and which are good or ill, according as ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with falſe or true light. But it is ſtill certain, that in all theſe encounters ſhe goes againſt the general order which ought to regulate the motions of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror part, and which ſhe herſelf uſeth to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in her ordinary actions, there being nothing more reaſonable then to flye when we are weakeſt, to aſſault when ſtrongeſt, and to reſiſt upon equal terms.</p>
                        <p>But it is not enough to know that the Soul reſiſts;
<note place="margin">Why Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts ill.</note> we muſt ſee what the end is of this reſiſtance, and what profit ſhe gets thereby; for it ſeems as if it would be more advantagious for her to flie thoſe ills which ſeem invincible, then to expoſe herſelf to its violence, and ſuffer thoſe efforts which may give her, if not much diſcommodity, yet at leaſt much trouble, conſidering alſo
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47499:274"/>her natural averſion towards it, its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal effect being to put it by, and eſtrange it from her preſence, ſhe ought to follow the motion of this Paſſion, and not expect an enemy ſhe cannot overcome.</p>
                        <p>Did Reaſon onely engage her to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, it were eaſie to diſcover the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ſhe pretends to make; thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of honor and glory which ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly propoſeth in thoſe encounters, would evidently make it appear, that ſhe aſpires to thoſe noble rewards, and that thoſe are the fruits which her Courage pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to gather; but becauſe theſe motives are extraordinary, and unknown to the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as hath been ſhewn, that they are not in beaſts; and that in our ſelves Reaſon doth not always force the inferior part, but ſuffers it to go its common road; we muſt ſeek ſome other end proper and natural unto it, and ſee what ſhe pretends unto, when ſhe takes a reſolution to reſiſt thoſe ills which aſſault her.</p>
                        <p>To ſpeak to the purpoſe, it's not ſo eaſie to be diſcovered as ſome may think. And we muſt confeſs, that that light which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the Soul in thoſe occaſions, is of the rank of thoſe which Nature ſheds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in all thoſe things, which without knowing, know whereto they ought to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47499:275"/>tend, and which without perceiving it moves to their end. The Soul indeed knows that ſhe ought to aſſault ill, and that ſhe ought to overcome it; that ſhe ought to reſiſt it, and that ſhe muſt oppoſe violence; but ſhe knows not why; and the underſtanding it ſelf, which often doth the ſame actions, is not always adviſed of the true motion which made it undertake them.</p>
                        <p>Upon this ground we may ſay, that as the Soul aſſaults her enemy out of hope to overcome him, and that ſhe ſeeks to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him; to take from him the power of doing ill; that ſhe alſo reſiſts him not to take away his power, but onely to ſtop the courſe thereof, and hinder it from produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing its effect; that the advantage ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make from this hinderance, is to retard her own loſs as long as ſhe reſiſts; or to cauſe the enemy to loſe its will to contuinue his aſſaults, letting of him know that with the ſtrength ſhe hath, ſhe cannot be overcome. And laſt of all, to ſhun the danger wherein ſhe would be engaged, did ſhe but yield or take flight; for ſhe can never ſlye but ſhe muſt forſake and quite abandon her Strength and Courage, and to augment thoſe of her enemy, or at leaſt give him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to do all the ill he is capable of.</p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:47499:275"/>
                        <p>In effect, did we not oppoſe grief, fear, and other evils which are in us, they would overflow all the parts of the ſoul, and would bring her to languiſh and to deſpair: Did we not conſtantly ſuffer injuries, adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and other miſchiefs which come from without the imagination, ſeeing no means whereby to ſtop their courſe, would fanſie them greater then they are, and make them always appear extream and inſufferable; did we not even ſometimes ſtiffen under the burthen of our ſufferings, we ſhould be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by their weight; and thoſe parts which yielded to the violence thereof, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thoſe which upheld them, would batter them by their fall, and fill them with grief. In a word, whatſoever ill the Soul would flie, ſhe is in the ſame danger that a Souldier caſts himſelf into who falls before his enemy, or that a whole Army incurs when it flies the ſight of a Conqueror, who comes pouring down upon it.</p>
                        <p>Let's then conclude, that the motive which ſhe propoſeth in Boldneſs, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave the enemy of the power of doing ill, that in Conſtancy ſhe onely ſuſpends its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and that in Fear ſhe ſeeks to ſhun it by flight. Now as there is more ſecurity to have no enemy, then to have one who doth harm us; and neither is this ſo much to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47499:276"/>be feared as one who puts himſelf in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to do it: So it's alſo true, that the Soul is more ſecure in Boldneſs which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys ill, then in Conſtancy which hinders onely its effect: As for the ſame reaſon, ſhe ever thinks to fight before ſhe thinks of her own defence, and never reſolves to flye but at her greateſt extremity, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her worſt condition and the ſaddeſt poſture ſhe can be reduced unto, leaving the enemy with full power and liberty to work her ruine.</p>
                        <p>The ſoul then reſiſts the ills which aſſault her,
<note place="margin">Why Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts ill.</note> to ſtop the courſe of them; Let's now ſee how ſhe reſiſts them. For we queſtion not here that exterior reſiſtance, which is performed by the action of the parts which oppoſe themſelves againſt the efforts of thoſe things which might harm them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, there ate ills, againſt which the motions of the Soul would in vain employ this reſiſtance, as thoſe which are purely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual are; for it reſiſts not afflictions by the oppoſition of corporal forces, but by her own proper ſtrength. Beſides that, the motions of the Appetite do not always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the organs, whether it be becauſe they are reſtrained by Reaſon, or becauſe they are ſometimes formed ſo quickly, and move ſo readily that it's impoſſible they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47499:276"/>ſhould have time to communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Body. It's certain that all theſe exterior motions, which are obſerved in the Paſſions, are the effects and ſequels of thoſe which are formed within the Soul; ſo that if the Body reſiſt outwardly, the Soul alſo muſt within herſelf perform the ſame action, or to ſpeak it better, ſhe muſt of herſelf reſiſt before ſhe can reſiſt by the Bodies means. So that we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſeek in what manner ſhe makes this ſecret and inward reſiſtance, which ſhe employs againſt ſpiritual ills and which is the ſource and cauſe of that which ſhe cauſeth to be made in the organs. This will be nothing difficult, having ſo often ſhewn that the agitations of the body are the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the Characters of thoſe which are made in the Appetite; that there is ſome relation and ſome reſemblance betwixt them; and that the Soul exciting both of them, its very likely ſhe would render them as uniform as ſhe can.</p>
                        <p>Now we experiment it in our ſelves, that when we muſt make an outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt a puiſſant Adverſary, we ſtop and remain firm; and to fortifie our ſelves againſt his aſſaults, we ſtiffen our Muſcles and our Nerves, and there is no part about us which becomes not harder,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47499:277"/>and more ſolid by the effort which we give our ſelves: Somewhat therefore like this muſt be done in the Soul, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe muſt neceſſarily ſtop and confirm herſelf, that gathering her forces together ſhe muſt ſtiffen herſelf in herſelf: In a word, ſhe muſt take, as it were, a kinde of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, which yields not eaſily to the ſhock and aſſault of the enemy.
<note place="margin">The ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fening of the Soul ſtops the courſe of ill, and how.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are now to ſee how ſhe can ſtiffen herſelf, and of what nature this Firmneſs is, which ſhe makes uſe of in this occaſion; but becauſe this hath been already done in the Diſcourſe of Hope, and that in that place the Reader may finde wherewith to ſatisfie his curioſity, It will be ſufficient to examine here what it is that makes this ſtifneſs, and whether it be a means able to ſtop the courſe and violence of the ills which aſſault the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>For it ſeems at firſt, that this firmneſs ſerves to this purpoſe onely but in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, which being unable to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate one another are conſtrained to ſtop when they meet with any which yields not to their motion; ſo that in ſtiffening the Body, and keeping of it firm, we ſuſtain the weight of a burthen, we break the current of a wave and of a torrent; we ſtop the impetuoſity of an enemy which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47499:277"/>preſſeth upon us, and would overthrow us.</p>
                        <p>But in thoſe things which have no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the Will and Appetite, the ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which either of them takes, cannot in all likelihood ſtop the courſe nor the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ill, whether corporal or ſpiritual, the reaſon of penetration having no place in thoſe things. In effect, let the ſoul ſtiffen and ſtrengthen it ſelf as much as ſhe can, ſhe cannot ſtop the leaſt corporal motion, unleſs ſhe alſo ſtiffen the parts and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the Body ſhe animates. And if ſhe aſſaults thoſe ills which are truly or any way ſpiritual, ſuch as are injuries, miſhaps, afflictions, and the like; this ſtiffening we have ſpoken of ſeems to be a means altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſs to reſiſt it.</p>
                        <p>Let's firſt therefore ſay,
<note place="margin">Two forts of Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> that there is two ſorts of Firmneſs; the one which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from material qualities, and is onely to be found in hard and ſolid Bodies; the other comes from the impetuoſity of the motion, and is common to all things which move, whether corporal or ſpiritual. Thus Water, Air, and Wind which are of a flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id nature, and yield eaſily, acquire a firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by their agitation, which ſtops the moſt ſolid Bodies. Thus Angels, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and all ſeparated ſubſtances reſtrain
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47499:278"/>one the other, according as their motions are more powerful, as we have elſewhere manifeſted it. Now the Firmneſs which the Appetite hath is of this kinde; for it proceeds from the only motion it makes in ſtiffening it ſelf, even as the members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come firm by the tonick motion, of which we have ſpoken in the Diſcourſe of Hope. And as by the firſt ſtiffening the bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, becauſe they are hard and impenetrable; ſo alſo by the latter, all other things reſiſt by reaſon of the motion which they make, which ſtops what it encounters, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with it. So that the Appetite reſiſts ills, by making a contrary to what they make.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe there are ſome which are corporeal, and other ſpiritual; it's certain, that the Firmneſs which this part of the ſoul takes in ſtiffening it ſelf, cannot of it ſelf alone ſtop corporal motions, how weak ſoever they are, but neceſſarily the exterior organs muſt contribute thereunto, and that if it be formed without them, it would prove a vain and uſeleſs violence, and an imperfect motion, which would not move to that end which Nature had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it. For ſhe hath afforded the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite the power to ſtiffen it ſelf at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of corporal and ſenſible ills, but
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47499:278"/>onely to inſpire the ſame motion in thoſe Faculties which are under its direction, and cauſe the organs to make that reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is neceſſary in thoſe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe ills which truly, or in ſome manner are ſpiritual, we muſt conſider whether they have motion, as Grief, Fear, and the reſt of the Paſſions; for it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that theſe may be ſtopped and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reſiſtance onely which the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite makes by ſtiffening it ſelf in it ſelf. Foraſmuch as water loſeth its rapidity, and even its fluidity when it ſettles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geals; ſo when the Appetite ſtiffens it ſelf, the motions of the reſt of the Paſſions muſt ceaſe or diminiſh. If the Soul indeed ſhut it ſelf up in Grief, if it dilate it ſelf in Joy, if it retire it ſelf in Fear, we need not doubt but Conſtancy foreſeeing theſe motions, or arriving afterwards muſt needs hinder or reſtrain them, bereaving the Appetite of the liberty or facility of moving it ſelf by that ſtifneſs which ſhe imprints in it.</p>
                        <p>But when the ills are without motion, as injuries, exiles, poverty, in a word, all thoſe which are not in the rank of Paſſions, we cannot ſay that the Appetite properly and immediately reſiſts them; for that it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47499:279"/>cannot reſiſt thoſe things which move not, as hath been ſaid; conſequently thoſe ills muſt then have had ſome motion; but it reſiſts them onely by oppoſing it ſelf to thoſe Paſſions which they uſually cauſe. Truly he that conſtantly ſuffers Poverty, doth not properly reſiſt Poverty, but the grief, the impatience, the peeviſhneſs which follows after it. And he that ſuffers death with a courage, cannot truly reſiſt death, ſince it as yet is not, but onely Fear, Grief and Deſpair which the image of ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an ill raiſeth up in the Soul. Neither are all theſe things Ills in effect, but onely as we know that they are ſo; foraſmuch as a Man who thinks not himſelf poor ſuffers not the Ills of Poverty; and that there are many who effectually are ſo, and who have the knowledge of it, yet place it not in the ranck of Evils. So that ill is not ill but from the knowledge and the reſentment we have of it. Now the knowledge is no true motion, there being no part of the Soul which moves but the Appetite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no reſiſtance to be made againſt ill, when it continues in the Knowledge, but onely when it deſcends in the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titive part, where it forms thoſe Paſſions which the Soul may reſiſt, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:47499:279"/>
                        <p>Let's return to our former Diſcourſe, and ſay, That after having cleared all thoſe dfficulties, it ſeems as if nothing could hinder us from defining <hi>Conſtancy to be a motion of the Appetite, whereby the Soul ſettles and ſtiffens herſelf in herſelf, to reſiſt thoſe ills which aſſault her.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this definition raiſeth new doubts;
<note place="margin">Wherein Hope and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy conſiſt.</note> for if the Soul ſettle and ſtiffen it ſelf in hope to reſiſt difficulties; and if this ſtiffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the difference of the motion which diſtinguiſheth this Paſſion from the reſt, as hath been ſaid; Conſtancy, to which we give the ſame definition, is nothing differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from Hope, or that neither of them are well defined. If indeed we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the Paſſions nothing but the ſimple agitation which the Appetite gives it ſelf, this conſequence certainly were infallible; but it is not the onely thing which ſpecifies the Paſſion; there is another motive which regulates this motion, which is as it were the form of it, and reſtrains it to ſuch or ſuch a ſpecies. So that according as the corporal motions are different the one from the other, by the difference of the term and end which they tend unto; thoſe of the Soul are diverſified by the ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſhe propoſeth to herſelf. So we have obſerved, that ſhe equally darted herſelf
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47499:280"/>forth in Deſire and in Boldneſs, and that notwithſtanding ſhe ſuffered two different Paſſions; foraſmuch as in the one ſhe dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf forth towards the good, that ſhe might draw near it; and that in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe caſts herſelf forth againſt ill, that ſhe might aſſault and combate it. We may alſo ſay, that in Hope and in Conſtancy ſhe moves after the ſame manner; that ſhe ſtiffens herſelf in both to reſiſt the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but that there are different motives which diſtinguiſh them from one the other. For in Hope ſhe ſtiffens herſelf not actually to reſiſt difficulties, but onely to put her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a condition to reſiſt them, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſhe be aſſaulted by them; Foraſmuch as ſhe conſiders not the ill but by the way, as a thing far off, as an enemy ſhe can maſter; but in Conſtancy ſhe ſtiffens her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf effectually to reſiſt it, becauſe it's preſent that aſſaults her, and ſeems invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible: So that we may ſay, that the Soul in both theſe Paſſions, doth like the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of an Army when he paſſeth through an enemies Country, and when he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſurprized in ſome Ambuſcado; in the one being doubtful of meeting the enemy, he marcheth in good order, he keeps his guards, and puts himſelf in poſture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance if he ſhould be aſſaulted; in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47499:280"/>other he findes himſelf engaged amongſt them before he was aware of them; and of neceſſity, unleſs he will flie, he muſt defend himſelf: Even ſo when the Soul hopes for any good, ſhe marcheth towards it through all thoſe difficulties which environ it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in doubt of being aſſaulted by them, ſhe ſtands on her guard, fortifies &amp; prepares her ſelf to fight if they ſhould come and aſſault her; but in Conſtancy ſhe finds herſelf ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the ill, which perhaps ſhe had never expected, had ſhe but had time to have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it; nor dares ſhe aſſault it, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do ought elſe but oppoſe herſelf to its violence, and bear its effort.</p>
                        <p>Having cleared this doubt, another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth far more important, which alſo is more difficult to reſolve; for if the Soul ſtiffens herſelf in Conſtancy, and if by its means ſhe reſiſts Grief, and Joy, and the reſt of the Paſſions, the Appetite muſt be agitated with contrary motions; and for example, oppoſing it ſelf to Joy, it muſt ſtiffen it ſelf at the ſame time when it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it ſelf,
<note place="margin">How Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy may be compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the reſt of the Paſſions.</note> and conſequently ſuffer two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and incompatible motions.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems very eaſie to anſwer this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, if it were true, That Beaſts were not able to reſiſt their Paſſions, and that this kinde of Conſtancy were proper and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47499:281"/>peculiar unto Man, foraſmuch as we might then ſay, that theſe oppoſite motions would not be found together, and that reſiſtance muſt be formed in the Will, whilſt the other Paſſion did agitate the inferior parts; yet were it true that Man alone were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Conſtancy, as it is very likely, the difficulty would ſtill remain entire, ſince its certain that the Will may reſiſt its own motions; and that being ſuſceptible of all the Paſſions which touch at the Sences, and there being ſome of them particular which are unknown to the inferior parts, ſuch are Envy, Ambition and Impudence: Neceſlarily in oppoſing the Paſſion of Conſtancy, ſhe muſt at the ſame time ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe contrary motions, even commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them to the Appetite, when ſhe is conſtrained by its to reſiſt thoſe motions which agitate it.</p>
                        <p>Let's firſt therefore ſay, that the Will and the Appetite may engage themſelves in ſo great a reſiſtance, and ſettle and ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen themſelves ſo ſtrongly, that they will not be able to ſuffer any other motion; and that in this condition if they have not hitherto received a Paſſion, they will alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether hinder it from forming it ſelf; or if it already be there, they will ſtifle it and ſtop its courſe by the firmneſs which they
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47499:281"/>have confirmed themſelves in. And it is certainly ſo, that a ſtrong and magnanimous man ſo ſtreng thens his Courage againſt injuries, loſſes, and other accidents of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that they make no impreſſion in his Soul; or if he be ſurpriſed by them, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtifles the reſentment of vengeance, and of the affliction which they give him. Now in this caſe it's certain, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience propoſed is not to be feared, becauſe that then the Will and the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite are agitated with one motion onely, and that they are moved by no other Paſſion but this, Conſtancy and ſtrength of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; but when they ſtiffen not themſelves ſo much, and that their Firmneſs is not ſo great but that they may alſo ſuffer ſome other motion; then you muſt imagine that the ſame thing happens to them as unto the Air, when it's agitated with contrary winds, or the Sea when it ſuffers in ſome ſtreights the encounter of ſeveral currents and the ſhock of the encountring waves; for as in thoſe Bodies which are fluid, and yield eaſily, there are parts which make way through others, which are driven by a contrary motion; It's very likely that the Will and the Appetite have alſo ſeveral parts which may be agitated with different motions, and that in ſome of them the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47499:282"/>which Joy requires, will be made whilſt the reſt ſtiffen themſelves to reſiſt it; And this may eaſily be perſwaded, if we conſider that the reaſonable Soul and the intelligence which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undiviſible, have, as it were, divers parts, wherein we may receive different a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations.</p>
                        <p>Or we muſt ſay, that even as the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of two oppoſite motions makes not the Bodies which receive them move at the ſame time forwards and backwards; but it confounds theſe two motions, ſo that if they are of an equal ſtrength, the body moves neither this way nor that, or elſe it moves but on that ſide whereto the ſtrongeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells it, but more weakly then it would have done, had it not been kept back by the other: So when the Will and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite are agitated with any motion, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary thereunto happen, a certain mixture is made which weakens them both, and which alſo diminiſheth thoſe Paſſions which are formed of it. And indeed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience we know, that Conſtancy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens affliction, but that this alſo abates very much of her force, and that from time to time the Soul had need to reanimate its Courage, and to take up new Arms for to continue her own defence, and not ſuffer herſelf to be overcome.</p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:47499:282"/>
                        <p>Now for the reſt,
<note place="margin">The Will onely can reſist the Paſſions.</note> how ſtrange ſoever it ſeem that we have placed the Will and the Appetite as parallels to one another; yet it's certain that the inferior part alone is not able to reſiſt theſe Paſſions, but that the ſuperior muſt inſpire it with the deſign and motion; otherwiſe the imagination which propoſeth to the Appetite deſigns which it ought to take in its motions, muſt at the ſame time make unto it two contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, the one to form the Paſſion, and the other to ſtop it, which is above the power of a material and determinate Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Nay, even the Underſtanding how ſeparate ſoever it be from matter, and how univerſal ſoever it be, would never go ſo far, had ſhe not thoſe ſeveral ſtages, and thoſe ſeveral degrees which its known to have.</p>
                        <p>For thoſe who have moſt curiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the nature thereof, confeſs that there are, as it were, two parts in it; the one of which is low, next to the ſenſitive Soul, and which by reaſon of that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood ſuffers it ſelf to be eaſily carried away, and corrupted by the ſences; the other is more pure and raiſed up higher, which for that cauſe is called the top and height of the Underſtanding, wherein God hath effuſed the light of true Reaſon, and the ſeeds of all the vertues; and it's that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47499:283"/>alſo which inſpires the Will to reſiſt thoſe Paſſions which the other hath raiſed there, unknown or contrary to its advice; thus theſe contrary deſigns whereof we have ſpoken, are not formed by one and the ſame power, ſince that which ſerves for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is formed in the higheſt part of the Underſtanding, and that which ſerves to that Paſſion to which it is to be oppoſed, is made in the lower region.</p>
                        <p>But we have marched too far on preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices and on thorns;
<note place="margin">The Soul reſiſts not ill but by Conſtancy</note> let's leave theſe by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and theſe ſubjects, which with their difficulty aſtoniſh the mind: Let's onely obſerve, that Conſtancy and ſtrength of courage, is alone the only means by which the Soul truly reſiſts the Paſſions; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ordinary Philoſophy propoſeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto us, as to divert our thoughts from the object which raiſeth them, to weaken their power by Ratiocination, to fall upon other contrary Paſſions, and the like. Yet to conſider it well, therein there is no true reſiſtance; they are rather flights or fights then a ſimple defence. For when we will not conſider the injury which we receive, that is not to defend our ſelves from Anger, it's to flie it; even as it is to aſſault it, when we employ a contrary Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for to deſtroy it.</p>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:47499:283"/>
                        <p>But yet to deſerve the honor to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted them, in what way ſoever it were, we muſt have had the deſign; for we may divert a man from being angry; we may alſo inſpire another Paſſion in him which may appeaſe his fury, and fear may fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which may take from him that fence of vengeance which he may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. And yet a man will not ſay that in theſe encounters he reſiſts his Paſſion, for that he had it not in his intention. It is even ſo with Beaſts, in whom one Paſſion may weaken and deſtroy another, in whom the ſame Appetite may ſtiffen it ſelf, and by its ſtiffening hinder it ſelf from taking the impreſſion of another motion: No, they do not for that reſiſt their Paſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe beſides that they cannot, as I have ſaid, form the deſign of it; it muſt needs be that they muſt be able to reflect on their actions, againſt thoſe maxims which we have elſewhere eſtabliſhed. Let's then conclude, that Conſtancy is a motion of the Appetite, by which the Soul confirms and ſtiffens it ſelf in it ſelf, with an intention to reſiſt thoſe ills which aſſault it.</p>
                        <p>To examine now thoſe ills, would be to fall into uſeleſs and impertinent repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for they are the ſame which move Boldneſs, and all what we have ſaid of them
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47499:284"/>in that place, may be here applied. It will ſuffice if we remember that under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ill, we underſtand not onely a pure privation, but alſo the cauſes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, and the incommodities which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; and that the two latter are the true ills which the Soul reſiſts.

                        <p>We ſhould have nothing more to ſay on this ſubject, did not the method which we have followed in the reſt of the Paſſions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to obſerve the moſt remarkable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Conſtancy, and chiefly thoſe which may ſerve to afford us a reaſon for thoſe Characters which ſhe imprints in the Soul and in the Body. Let's then ſay, that there are none eſſential, foraſmuch as the motion and the motive which cauſe all the eſſence of this Paſſion, are equally to be found in all ſorts of Conſtancy; as for thoſe which we call accidental, the moſt remarkable are drawn from the ſubject wherein ſhe is found, or from the object which raiſeth it, or from the relation which it hath with Reaſon: For if we conſider its ſubject, it hath one which is in the Will, and another which is in the ſenſitive Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: In reſpect of the Object there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts, according to the ſeveral ſorts of ill which aſſault the Soul; but the moſt conſiderable is that which reſiſts the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47499:284"/>and that which oppoſeth it ſelf to the violence and endeavors of exterior ills; this is common to all Animals, and depends altogether on corporal ſtrength, namely on thoſe which are moſt proper to ſuffer, ſuch as are to be found in the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temperature, of which we have ſpoke in the Diſcourſe of Boldneſs; the other is proper and peculiar for Men, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for thoſe which are moſt reaſonable, becauſe it's commonly Reaſon which moves us to oppoſe the Paſſions, ſo that herein there needs no other ſtrength but that of the Soul; wherefore thoſe whoſe ſpirits are ſtrong by nature or by ſtudy, are moſt ſuſceptible of it: It's true, that the force of the minde depends often from the temperature; whence it is that young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Women whoſe ſpirits by reaſon of their conſtitution are leſs ſtrong, are troubled to reſiſt their Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>Finally, There are ſome that are vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, others vicious, according as they are conformable or contrary to right Reaſon, and ſo ſerve for the matter of Vertues or Vices. In effect, Juſtice borroweth from this Paſſion Firmneſs which is neceſſary unto it to reſiſt Love, Hatred and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things as might corrupt it; Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance could not moderate the motions of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47499:285"/>the concupiſcible Appetite but by its means; and thoſe Vertues which force produceth by reſiſtance, ſuch as are Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Conſtancy and Perſeverance, are maintained onely by it. On the contrary, when ſhe ſtraggles out of the right way, and abandons the conduct of Reaſon, there is no Vice which ſhe doth not encourage and aſſiſt, becauſe ſhe alone reſiſts thoſe motions which the Conſcience inſpires al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in thoſe who undertake or execute any evil deſign: But although ſhe may be found in all vicious actions, there are ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe appears more, as in Temerity, in Hard-heartedneſs, and in Opiniaſtrecy, as we ſhall hereafter make it appear.</p>
                        <p>Now all thoſe terms wherewith we uſe to expreſs Boldneſs, are alſo employed for Conſtancy; For to ſay a man hath ſuffered death Conſtantly, we uſe to ſay he hath ſuffered it with a Courage, with Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with Aſſurance, without fear, and without apprehenſion; and this happens from that Conſtancy is as it were a demy Boldneſs, at leaſt it is inſtead of it, when it hath no cauſe to fight, whether we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the enemy, or becauſe its forces are not ſufficient to aſſault it. Wherefore the ſame cauſes and the ſame preparatives which ſerve the one do alſo ſerve the other.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47499:285"/>And certainly, after the Soul hath found its forces to be equal with thoſe of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which aſſaults her, ſhe aſſures herſelf that ſhe ſhall not be conquered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſhe hath no cauſe to be affraid: In purſuit whereof ſhe takes a Reſolution to reſiſt him, and for that cauſe ſhe raiſeth her forces, that ſhe may ſtiffen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm herſelf in herſelf, and if it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhe cauſeth the ſame motion to be made in the outward organs. As for Courage it's certain that it's in common with Boldneſs, and with Conſtancy, for the Reaſons alleadged in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                        <p>SInce the ſpirits follow the motions of the Soul,
<note place="margin">How the Spirits ſtiffen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> and that they always move as ſhe moves; if it be true that ſhe ſtiffens herſelf in Conſtancy, they muſt needs alſo ſuffer the ſame agitation; ſo that ſince we have treated of their ſtiffening in the Diſcourſe of Hope, it ſeems that we ſhould have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to ſay here, unleſs we ſhould
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47499:286"/>repeat thoſe things which we have there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready examined. Yet beſides that, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this motion is extreamly hid, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the repetition of theſe obſcure and difficult things uſeleſs, and that it would be troubleſom to ſeek far off what ought to be here known; it's fit we ſhould repeat a part of the things which we have ſaid, adding thereunto ſome new conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the better clearing of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                        <p>We muſt firſt therfore remember that the Spirits ſtiffen themſelves not by congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, as it happens in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, foraſmuch as that would render them immoveable, and that this Paſſion hinders them not from being carried to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they are neceſſary, nor reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking themſelves up in themſelves, for that they cannot reſtrain themſelves but they muſt retire inwardly, and then it muſt needs be that contrary to the nature of Conſtancy the face muſt look pale and change colour, the blood with which they are mixed being forced to follow them, and as they do, to abandon the exterior parts. They therefore ſtiffen themſelves by the intermiſſion of the Soul, which ſubjects their parts to a certain order under which it reſtrains them, without being more free
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47499:286"/>or Vagabonds, as before they were. But to conceive this kinde of motion, which is extreamly hid, and moſt difficult to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, we muſt make uſe of the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which we formerly made uſe of, and imagine that it herein happens near upon as water which ſettles and congeals: For thoſe parts which before were fluid, being ſeiſed by the cold which is inſinuated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, ſtop and become firm without confounding or mixing themſelves together: whilſt all the body of the water ſo ſettled may be tranſported from one place to another; and the current of Rivers often draws along with it great pieces which tear down thoſe Bridges and Dams which they meet in their way: But with what rapidity ſoever they are then carried away, their parts change neither the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor the order which they keep amongſt themſelves without penetrating; they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt one another maintain themſelves; and they remain firm without confounding themſelves, juſt as long time as the cold keeps them bound and captivated.</p>
                        <p>The Soul doth the ſame in the Spirits; ſhe ſheds and ſlides herſelf into all their parts, and being ſhe may place them as ſhe pleaſeth, ſhe ſtops them in what order ſhe will, and lead them as it were by the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47499:287"/>hand to the place ſhe aſſigns them; ſo that how fluid ſoever they be, the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mixed with the reſt; and what agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſoever they ſuffer, they remain ſtable in that rank wherein they are placed.</p>
                        <p>Now although this compariſon may give us ſome knowledge of the condition, wherein the ſpirits are in this Paſſion; yet it ſhews us not what is moſt difficult to be known; for it ſuppoſeth, and it's true, that the parts of congealed water are no longer in motion, and we pretend that the ſpirits have one which entertains this ſtiffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We muſt therefore ſeek another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which may make this truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and have more relation to the Soul then cold hath, or any other ſenſible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                        <p>Without doubt,
<note place="margin">How the Angels ſtiffen Bodies.</note> this is to be found in the firmneſs which the Angels may give to the Air, and to ſome other fluid bodies; for beſides that they are ſubſtances which have a great natural conformity with the Soul; it's certain, that they agitate their Bodies after the ſame manner as ſhe doth the ſpirits, and that the ſtiffneſs which ſhe imprints on them excludes not motion, as it happens to congealed water.</p>
                        <p>Let's then ſuppoſe with the conſent of the Schools, that a certain ſpace of Air be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47499:287"/>occupied by an Angel, and that the Wind or ſome other Body ſeeks to move or pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate it; it's a certain thing that the Angel may ſo ſtiffen it that he may ſtop all its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors ſo that he cannot be ſhaken or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated by them.</p>
                        <p>To know now how he can impoſe this firmneſs, we muſt believe with the common opinion of Philoſophers, that the Angels have a motive vertue by which they move themſelves, and may alſo remove bodies, and tranſport them from one place to another, as all prophane and ſacred Hiſtories teach us. In effect it muſt needs be, that thoſe things which work the one on the other, muſt have ſome proportion together, and there muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them ſome common nature, which muſt ſerve for the foundation and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their action: Now there is nothing which can be common betwixt ſpiritual and corporeal ſubſtances, but the motive Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the Motion; and therefore if they work the one on the other, it muſt be by that means; which being ſo, the Angel cannot ſtiffen the Air but by the motion which it imprints in all its parts, ſince it's that onely which gives him power over bodies: And to ſhew that this is true, it is that he is able to be preſent with all thoſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47499:288"/>parts without ſtiffening them; ſo that it's neceſſary that he ſhould raiſe up his vigor, and agitate them, thereby to imprint on them this quality.</p>
                        <p>If any ſhould ſay, that being thus moved, they muſt needs either be driven, be drawn, be born, or be turned, becauſe theſe are the ſeveral ways by which one thing may be moved by another; and howſoever it may be done, they muſt neceſſarily change place; ſo that herein not changing it, and remaining ſtill in the ſame ſituation, there is no probability to beleeve that they ſuffer any motion.</p>
                        <p>We muſt anſwer, that it's true, that when the Angel imprints any motion in the Bodies, he neceſſarily makes them change place unleſs there happen ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle which hinders them: Now there is nothing which can hinder them but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motion, becauſe there is nothing common betwixt them but motion, and conſequently if there be no contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the parts of the Air, it's certain that the impreſſion which the Angel will make on them will cauſe them to change ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation: If it happen that after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, that they remain in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were, they muſt have had a contrary motion which reſiſts this impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47499:288"/>and which being of equal force with it, puts them in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> and keeps them as it were ſuſpended without ſtiring from one ſide to the other, wherein this firmneſs conſiſts.</p>
                        <p>But what? continuing thus firm and ſtable, and not changing place, can they be in motion? Certainly, We need not doubt it, ſince it is by motion that they keep this ſituation, and that we cannot deny but that the impreſſion of the motion muſt be received therein, but that it agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates on them, and that ſhe reſiſts not the firſt motion which they made, like as a great weight which we hold lifted up or high; for although it ſtill remain in the ſame place, yet would it not forbear to have that motion which its weight gives it, and we ſhould be ſenſible of the effort it would make, falling and returning to its centre. Finally, as it were nothing probable to ſay that a thing which were powerfully drawn on both ſides by equal forces, ſhould ſuffer no motion becauſe it would neither move on the one or on the other ſide; nor that the arm we ſtiffen ſhould be at reſt, becauſe it ſtill remains in the ſame place: Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Phyſitians being all agreed, that theſe are the moſt violent motions which bodies can ſuffer; we muſt neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47499:289"/>that thoſe parts of the Air which are ſtiffened by contrary motions are in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although they remain ſtable and change not their ſituation.</p>
                        <p>Let us now apply this Doctrine to our ſubject and ſay, that what the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel doth in this encounter, the Soul doth it on the ſpirits; for although ſhe be preſent to all their parts, yet ſhe renders them not ſtiff; ſhe muſt alſo move them, and before that they alſo muſt be moved by a contrary motion; ſo that being equally driven from one and another, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advance nor go back, but remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable betwixt theſe endeavors and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences. Now this firm motion which they ought to have, may proceed from the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which agitate them; Conſtancy ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom forming herſelf unleſs ſhe be prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome other Paſſion, or from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity they are driven unto in ſhips; for being very moveable, ſhe eaſily makes them ſtraggle from one the other, as it happens to all fluid Bodies, when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated; and then the Soul giving them a contrary motion proportionable to the firſt they had, they retain it, and ſtop them in a certain order which they change not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one or the other ceaſe. But although in this condition they appear immoveable
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47499:289"/>becauſe they remain in the ſame ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they forbear not to be in motion, as hath been already ſufficiently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p>This is what the motion of the ſpirits is in Conſtancy.
<note place="margin">Why the Spirits ſtiffen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> Let's now enquire the end and profit which the Soul propoſeth it ſelf in this firmneſs. We muſt not doubt but ſhe deſires them for her defence, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them to reſiſt thoſe ills which aſſault her; but at firſt it ſeems as an unprofitable means for that deſign: For if ills have no motion, as Exile, Infamy, and Slavery, this ſtifneſs were againſt them to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the reaſons before alleadged; and if they have any, either they are Paſſions which are formed in the Appetite, whoſe motions the ſpirits cannot hinder, or they are Bodies whoſe violence they cannot ſtop. In effect, what can this ſtiffening do againſt the effort of Grief, againſt the force of a blow, againſt the weight of a burthen which falls on them? No, being ſo eaſily overcome as they are, it ſeems that the Soul in vain uſeth them in theſe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that in vain ſhe oppoſeth herſelf againſt ſuch powerful things, againſt which ſhe is not able to reſiſt. We muſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly confeſs, that ſhe often abuſeth herſelf in the motion which ſhe gives thoſe organs,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47499:290"/>and that ſhe doth not always get thoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors which ſhe ought to expect from them, and that ſhe even ſometimes agitates them without any need. For when ſhe reſiſts the Paſſions, it's certain that neither the ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fening of the Spirits, nor any other moti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> on of the Body whatſoever, can be either neceſſary or uſeful unto her, ſince they are actions proper unto her, who never goes out of herſelf, and ſo conſequently is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the efforts of the corporal organs: Yet if ſhe then ceaſeth not to agitate them, it is from that that the Appetite which ſtirs up theſe motions, is a blind power, which cannot judge when ſhe ought to make uſe of thoſe parts; and they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to obey unto it; it rather in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion commands them out of cuſtom, then out of deſign; and they alſo are ſo obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that we may ſay that at the leaſt ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation it makes them that they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a readineſs to aſſiſt it, and that even they ſeem to prevent its orders and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                        <p>It is not ſo when the violence of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things is to be reſiſted; the ſtifneſs of the ſpirits is therein ſo abſolutely neceſſary, not onely becauſe they are bodies which may work powerfully on thoſe things of the ſame Nature; but alſo becauſe they
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47499:290"/>are the firſt which receives the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and carrieth them to all the reſt of the parts; for being employed in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, they muſt needs take that eſmoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they ought to inſpire in the reſt of the organs; and as an Ambaſſador ought to carry with him the ſence of him who ſent him, and be throughly perſwaded of what he is to make others beleeve; they ought to be agitated with the ſame moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Appetite ſuffers, and of thoſe which they would imprint on the reſt of the parts; ſo that they ſtiffen not themſelves immediately to reſiſt the forces of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but that they may ſtiffen the Muſcles and the Nerves againſt them, and ſo powerfully reſiſt their violence. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may conſider the body as a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine wherein are ſeveral Springs which move one another: The firſt go ſlowly, and ſeem almoſt not to move, although it is they which make the great Wheels to turn, and cauſe thoſe great motions which are obſerveable in them: The Spirits are the ſame thing; we hardly feel their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither is it they which perform the laſt actions, yet they lead the dance to all the reſt of the organs; and did that Spring but fail, all the Machine would become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, neither could the Body act any more.</p>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:47499:291"/>
                        <p>But the principal reaſon for the which, in my opinion they thus move, is, that their ſtiffening contributes to maintain the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which in this occaſion ought to be ſtiff; for the Soul which knows that all motion is to be made on ſomewhat which is ſtable, ſtiffens as much as it may the parts upon which thoſe which are agitated are ſupported; ſo that often ſhe holds back the breath, that that air which is ſtopped in the Lungs may ſerve to uphold the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of reſpiration, which thereby the better ſupport the reſt, as hath been elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewed. She therefore affords this ſtiffening of the Spirits to uphold thoſe veſſels wherein they are incloſed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they ſupport thoſe parts which touch them, and they again the reſt, to the very laſt, which ſerves for a foundation and baſis to the principal motion which is made; for although it ſeems that ſuch frail and moveable things are not very fit for that uſe, yet as the number of the Wheels and Springs augments the force of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo the number of Buttereſſes and Upholders renders the reſiſtance the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and ſometimes for want of the leaſt, a whole Building falls to the ground. It's true that if all the ſtifneſs of the Body were onely grounded on the Spirits, it would
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47499:291"/>be very doubtful and ſuſpitious: But as all the reſt of the parts alſo ſtiffen themſelves of themſelves, or at leaſt by the intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul, if the ſpirits contribute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little, it ſtill helps to make the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſtronger; and this ſmall ſuccour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with ſeveral others, produceth at laſt a great effect. Let us hereunto add, that being in this condition, thoſe which carry with them natural heat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the force of the parts principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they retain and fix it, if we may ſo ſpeak, in thoſe places where ſuch actions are to be performed, and not ſuffering it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire inwardly, nor diſſipating it outwardly, they ſtop and preſerve it in thoſe organs which have need of its ſervice.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the Reaſons for which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Conſtancy ſtiffen themſelves,
<note place="margin">What change Conſtancy brings in natural heat.</note> but the laſt gives us occaſion to examine what change this Paſſion brings to the natural heat; for if the ſpirits ſtop, as we have now ſaid, it ſeems as if it ſhould be the more quiet and the more moderate; yet this ought not to hinder us from following the general maxims which we eſtabliſhed in the Diſcourſe of Boldneſs, and from ſaying that when the Soul hath need of its forces, ſhe raiſeth them and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them as vigorous as ſhee can;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47499:292"/>that there is no occaſion in which they can be more neceſſary unto her, then when ſhe aſſaults or defends herſelf. And that heat being the moſt conſiderable part, ſhe muſt augment it, and ſtir it up in thoſe Paſſions, which are to ſerve theſe deſigns; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſhe muſt render it greater and ſtronger in Conſtancy then it naturally ought to be. This principally appears to be in thoſe which are of a cold and dull complexion, or which are moved by ſome timerous Paſſion; for when this comes to animate them, they feel themſelves warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with I know not what kinde of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary flame; their pulſe and reſpiration encreaſeth, their face takes a more lively colour, and all their parts become more agile, and more robuſtious then they were before. It's true, that heat is not ſo active nor pungent in this as in Boldneſs and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, having not the liberty to diffuſe it ſelf through the organs, being reſtrained by the ſpirits, which are ſtiffened, and becauſe it is not neceſſary it ſhould be ſo ſtrong in a Paſſion which is not undertaking, and which keeps it ſelf onely upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. We may perhaps ſay, that if the Soul ought to augment its forces propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the need ſhe hath, ſhe ought herein to render the heat ſtronger then in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47499:292"/>any other occaſion whatſoever, having an enemy in front which appears invincible, which alſo hath the advantage to be the Aſſailant under whoſe efforts ſhe often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhe muſt ſuccumb. But we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it's true, that ſhe hath here need of all her forces, that ſhe raiſeth them, and employs them for her defence; but it's onely thoſe which are fit for that purpoſe, ſince ſhe would in vain uſe others which are deſtined to aſſault, being not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do ſo, and having neither the Will nor the Courage; now the violence of heat is onely proper the more ſtrongly to work and to deſtroy the power of the enemy, in which conſiſts the end of the Combate and of Boldneſs; and therefore it's nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Conſtancy, which hath no ſuch great pretentions, and which hath nothing elſe to do but to keep the Soul ſtiff, and to render the organs firm againſt thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which aſſault it: It's certain that heat is encreaſed therein, but it is but to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree proportionable to the deſign, and capable to give the organs that force which is neceſſary for them to execute it. For it is not here as with thoſe Paſſions which tend to good, in which heat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth without order and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; becauſe it is not therein ordered by
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47499:293"/>the Soul; that is, it is not called thither as a uſeful thing for her end, and that it is but an effect which happens to the agitation of the ſpirits. But in this and in all the reſt which aſſault, the Soul herſelf takes care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce heat, ſhe propoſeth to herſelf to uſe it profitably, and ſhe regulates it as ſhe thinks fit. So that we may ſay that in this occaſion ſhe doth like a ſubtil Artiſt, who knows how to order his fire for his works; for ſome he makes it ſlow and moderate, for others ſtrong and violent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he forceth it to the height: the Soul doth the ſame, ſhe knows to what degree of heat ſhe ought to riſe in every of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; in Conſtancy, ſhe makes it mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſtrong in Boldneſs, but in Anger ſhe drives it to all extremity.</p>
                        <p>This is what we had to ſay on the motion of the Spirits; for to know how they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſtifneſs when they are agitated by other Paſſions, is what we have exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Diſcourſe of Hope. As for the motion of the Humors, it neceſſarily follows that of the Spirits which are ever mixt with them; and it's impoſſible to fancy that they ſhould ſtiffen themſelves in Conſtancy, but we muſt preſently judge they alſo ought to ſuffer the ſame agitation.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>The cauſes of the Characters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WE have ſaid that Conſtancy and Boldneſs were Siſters, whoſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and lineaments were ſo like, that a man might often take the one for the other; and indeed they have many Characters which are common to either, as Hope, Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Aſſurance in dangers, Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Temerity, Deſire of glory, and the like; but they alſo have ſome which are particular; for Conſtancy is not as Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, Imperious, neither is ſhe ſubject to Anger, to Inſolency, nor to Cruelty, which the other is often carried away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: She hath this property alſo to make men <hi>Patient, Perſevering, Opinionated, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, Modeſt in good Fortune, Severe in Pleaſures, Content in Neceſsity;</hi> and theſe latter we muſt carefully examine without minding the others, of which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcourſed in the former Chapter. And for theſe it will be ſufficient to ſay, that although they are common to both theſe Paſſions, yet they in every one of them have a difference in reſpect of the end
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47499:294"/>which it propoſeth it ſelf; for Conſtancy hopes as well as Boldneſs; but this hopes to overcome, and the other to ſtop onely the courſe of the evil; both have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their forces; but that promiſeth its ſelf help to aſſault it, and this onely to defend it ſelf; both of them may be Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, but the one hath the Temerity to aſſault an enemy that is too powerful, and the other onely to reſiſt him: Neither of them fears danger; that, becauſe it believes it ſelf ſtronger then the difficulties which preſent themſelves; And this judgeth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as ſtrong as they can be. Finally, both of them propoſe Glory in all their deſigns; but that aſpires to it by fighting and taking advantages over the enemy, and this by oppoſing his endeavors, and not yielding unto him. For it's certain, that who will not ſuffer himſelf to be overcome, renders himſelf equal to him who aſſaults him, and conſequently deſerves as much honor as is due unto the other; and even that in ſome encounters it's more glorious to reſiſt then to aſſault; either when the enemy is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and formidable; for then it's Temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to aſſault, and yet to reſiſt his power we had need of a great deal of Courage; or when he is too weak; for that were Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice and Injuſtice to take the advantage
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47499:294"/>which we have over him, and that it's to ſlight him, not to meaſure our forces with his. Thus it is that there is more glory to reſiſt Pleaſure and Ambition, or with ſmall Troops to oppoſe himſelf againſt a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army, then if we ſhould aſſault or would force them: It's thus that Lyons and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffs often ſuffer the aſſaults of little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without being moved, and that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and generous men ſcorn the weakneſs of their enemies, without ſeeking a victory which would but be ſhameful unto them.</p>
                        <p>To return to our former Diſcourſe: this Paſſion is no more ſubject then Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe defects which proceed from weakneſs and from fear, ſuch as are Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, Deceit, Cowardiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Conſtancy is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious.</note> becauſe it is couragious and hath a good opinion of its ſtrength. But ſhe hath this particularly, that ſhe is not imperious as the other is, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſhe carried away with Anger, Fury, or Cruelty; the reaſon is, that ſeeing ſhe pretends not to conquer, ſhe ſeeks not that preheminence nor ſuperiority which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for command; but alſo being ſhe will not be overcome, ſhe will alſo be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent; and without pretending to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſhe will neither yield nor obey: whence it is that ſhe renders not men
<pb facs="tcp:47499:295"/>haughty and proud but opiniated and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable, as we ſhall hereafter ſhew. As for Anger, Fury, and Cruelty, being turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and impetuous Paſſions, they are not not compatible with this which is reſerved and moderate. It's true, there is a kinde of Cruelty which it eaſily falls into; to wit, Hard-heartedneſs and inſenſibility of other mens ſufferings; but it is not an active Cruelty, as that is which perſecutes, which triumphs, and which exacts puniſhments; it's rather a defect then an exceſs; and if the Soul ſuffers not herein, yet ſhe leſs acts, as we ſhall ſhortly make it appear.</p>
                        <p>One of the firſt effects of Conſtancy is to render <hi>Men Patient.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">She is Patient.</note> But to underſtand this, we muſt know what we underſtand by the word <hi>Patience;</hi> for ſome confound it with Conſtancy; others reduce it to the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of injuries, others extend it to all ills which may be reſented. In effect, we ſay that a man hath patiently ſuffered an injury, a ſickneſs, or even death it ſelf; that with patience he hath ſuffered Exile, Slavery, the loſs of Goods, and of Friends; but we can never ſay that he hath patiently ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pleaſure, Ambition, or good Fortune, although we may ſay he hath conſtantly reſiſted them; thus Conſtancy ought to be more general then Patience, ſince ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47499:295"/>good and ill, and that the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns only troubleſom things; now ills have this property, that beſides that they ſhed abroad in the Concupiſcible part of the Soul, Hatred, Averſneſs and Grief, they alſo raiſe up in the Iraſcible part generous Paſſions to overcome them to Riot, Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Anger, or the timerous to flie them, as Fear and Deſpair; thoſe of the Concupiſcible part may ſubſiſt with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſeeing a man may be patient, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hate him who hath offended him, have an averſion againſt him, and be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the wrong which he hath done him; but we can never ſay that he is ſo, if he ſeek to revenge himſelf, if he appear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and if he abandon himſelf to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: So that to ſpeak properly, a Patient Man is he that ſuffers ill without being moved by any of thoſe motions which ill uſeth to ſtir up in the Iraſcible part, ſo as it happens not out of ſtupidity; for we never ſay, that he who hath loſt his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or is ſenſeleſs, is Patient, although he ſuffers his ill without any reſentment of revenge, without diſquiet, and without apprehenſion; but he muſt know that he feels it, and that he reſiſts it; And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Patience is a kinde of Conſtancy; or to ſay better, it is but its effect, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47499:296"/>much as this ſtiffening the Soul hinders the enterance in of the Paſſions, or diſſipates them when they are entred. And their abſence which is the effect of this ſtiffening, is what we call Patience; whence we muſt conclude, that as it happens from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which the Soul makes againſt the Paſſions, it's proper and peculiar to men, becauſe Beaſts are not able to reſiſt their Paſſions, as hath been declared.</p>
                        <p>She <hi>renders men perſevering,
<note place="margin">She is perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> being a kind of Conſtancy, by which the Soul ſtiffens herſelf againſt that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which the length of time produceth: For whether it be that the Faculties which ſhe employs are tired, or that the novelty of the objects obligeth her to alter her deſign, ſhe cannot long remain in the ſame action without trouble and diguſt, and then propoſing to herſelf the good which ought to happen unto her, if ſhe do not change ſhe fortifies herſelf againſt the difficulty which this length might cauſe, and ſtiffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf in her firſt deſign ſhe continues the action to the laſt. But that we may not confound things, we muſt remember that we ſpeak not here of Conſtancy, Patience, nor of Perſeverance as they are Habits; we conſider them onely as the actions of thoſe ſame Habits, or to ſay better, as the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47499:296"/>motions of the Soul which cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued when difficulties are encountred withal, but onely by this ſtiffening which we ſpeak of, which yet laſts not ſo long as Habits do, as the Schools teach us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we muſt not believe that Perſeverance properly and immediately reſiſts the length of time, becauſe it's an ill which is of the rank of thoſe which we have called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, as are Poverty, Exile, Death, and the like, againſt which the Souls reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is vain and uſeleſs; but it oppoſeth it ſelf againſt Frowardneſs, Fear, Diſquiet, and ſuch other Paſſions as ſhe uſually raiſeth up; ſo that it is not to be found in Beaſts, who know neither the parts nor differences of time, and which never reſiſt their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yet this may be doubted; for Dogs do a long while entertain the heat they have in hunting; and there are exerciſes which are taught them, wherein they are ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent either out of Fear or out of Hope, that it's very probable theſe two Paſſions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to ſtiffen themſelves in their firſt deſign to ſhun the ill, or to enjoy the good propoſed unto them. But to ſpeak to the purpoſe, it is but a ſhadow or fantaſm of Perſeverance, foraſmuch as to perſevere tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt know the length of the time to be employed in the performance of a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47499:297"/>thing, be ſenſible of thoſe Paſſions which accompany it, and afterwards take a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to reſiſt them. Now this cannot be but by great abſtractions which Beaſts are incapable of, as hath been ſhewed; they may indeed continue a commenced action, and perſiſt a long while in the labor; but it's the other Paſſions which keep them in breath, and drive them to that end which they aim at, without any neceſſity of the Souls ſtiffening it ſelf to continue them in the action, and to reſiſt thoſe difficulties which the length of time might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
                        <p>To be <hi>Opinionate</hi> is another kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
<note place="margin">She is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionate</note> by which ſhe remains firm and ſtable in her reſolutions, by unadviſedly oppoſing another mans reaſons, and perſwaſions: Now a man may ſeveral ways unadviſedly oppoſe himſelf to ill, either when he knows they are beſt, and yet he will not follow them; or when he flatters himſelf in his own opinion, and perſwades himſelf it's moſt reaſonable, although it be nothing ſo; or even when indeed it is the beſt, and we perſiſt againſt it unreaſonably; for there are occaſions, and places, and perſons which oblige us to yield, and which ought to make us quit our reſentments and pretences. How ever it be, a conſtant man eaſily falls
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47499:297"/>into all thoſe kindes of Opinionateneſs; for that Confidence having ſtiffened the Soul againſt thoſe difficulties which aſſault her, there is no further perſwaſion which can take place, ſo that by the ſame reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereby ſhe ſeeks to ſtop ill, ſhe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Truth and Reaſon; ſo that ſhe doth like a beſieged Town, where the gates which are ſhut to the enemies, hinder all friends and releif from entring in. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this Opinionaſtrecy commonly comes from Preſumption which will not yield nor ſubmit to another mans judgement; and conſequently that Conſtancy which hath a great opinion of its forces, and believes it ſelf invincible, is eaſily abaſed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence it hath in it ſelf, which cauſing it to deſpiſe all advice and help from others, renders it incredulous, indocible and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionaſted.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes ſhe advanceth even to Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs, and to Inſenſibility;
<note place="margin">She is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ill.</note> for in the power that ſhe hath to ſtop all the reſt of the Souls motions, ſhe may hinder herſelf from being ſenſible of the miſeries of another, which is, as hath been ſaid, a kinde of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and inhumanity. For Nature which takes care for ſociety, gives us a certain tenderneſs to reſiſt the ills of thoſe which are afflicted, that we might relieve them:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47499:298"/>And when a man hath ſo hardened his heart that he cannot be mollified by the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pitty, certainly we may ſay, that he wants not onely the Heart of a Man, but that he is of Marble or of Iron. Beyond all, we muſt not wonder if Conſtancy eaſily falls into this defect, ſince its principal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is to reſiſt Grief, which is a good part of Compaſſion, as in its place we ſhall declare.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>She is Modeſt in good Fortune,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">She is modeſt in proſperity</note> becauſe with the ſtifneſs which ſhe gives herſelf it's almoſt impoſſible for her to ſuffer her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſwelled with Pride, or blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with Vanity; and that Inſolency which is commonly bred from one of thoſe two Paſſions, may render its proſperity odious.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>She is Severe in Pleaſures,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">She is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in Pleaſure.</note> not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in ſtiffening herſelf ſhe ſtops thoſe motions which they might raiſe, and that they ſerve her as a bank to hinder them from over-flowing: but alſo becauſe ſhe findes herſelf in their preſence ſeiſed with a certain frowardneſs, and with I know not what bitterneſs of mind, which mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf with the joy which they give, weaken her, and take from her thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, thoſe raptures, and thoſe ſweets which are wont to accompany her, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47499:298"/>her <hi>Serious, Reſerved and Severe.</hi> But how can ſuch ſweet and charming things cauſe peeviſhneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis without doubt, that ſhe conſiders them as ills; now the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ill is unpleaſant, and although it caſt not the Soul always into grief, yet it gives her I know not what kinde of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte, which renders her wary and peeviſh; and truly as liking is the firſt thing which good inſpires, which is not, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, a Paſſion, or at leaſt, which is but a breeding Joy: ſo before ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth hatred and ſadneſs in the Soul, it produceth therein a certain angry ſence, which is not a motion of the Appetite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it remains ſimply in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which obſerves the diſproportion which is betwixt it and the Object; yet forbears not to diſquiet it, and to give it this ſecret peeviſhneſs which we ſpeak of, which is neither Hatred nor Grief; at leaſt, if we may ſo call it, it is but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement thereof. Howſoever it be, when the Soul reſiſts Pleaſures, they no longer are graceful objects unto her; ſhe looks on them as on poyſons to corrupt her, and conceives the ſame averſion for them which ſhe hath for all ſuch as may deſtroy her; for which cauſe we muſt not think it ſtrange if they render her Severe and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47499:299"/>peeviſh, ſince they are the ſence which the preſence of ill is always accuſtomed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print.</p>
                        <p>But if this be ſo,
<note place="margin">How Joy is to be found with Grief.</note> How is Joy to be found in the violence of Grief, of Scorn, and of Infamy, with all thoſe evills which ſo often exerciſe Conſtancy? For if it be true, that evils alwayes bring peeviſhneſs with them, thoſe which are the greateſt we can ſuffer, muſt needs fill the Soul with Grief, nor permit never ſo little a Joy to have any place in her; and yet it is true, that the moſt part of Lovers take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſuffering for thoſe they love; that the Ambitious bravely ſupport thoſe traverſes which they meet with in the way to Glory; and that Martyrs have always had contentment in their Souls, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor in their Looks in the greateſt of their torments and ſufferings. Yet this difficulty is eaſily reſolved, if we do but remember that there are two Appetites in Man, which at the ſame time may be moved with two contrary Paſſions; and that in the Will it ſelf there are, as it were, two parts, which may be agitated with ſeveral motions; for theſe truths being ſuppoſed, it's eaſie to conceive how Grief aſſaults the Sences, whilſt Joy ſheds it ſelf abroad in the Mind, and how Sadneſs diſturbs the lower region
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47499:299"/>of the Will, whilſt the higher is quiet, as raviſhed with thoſe pleaſures which Love, Ambition, or ſome other noble Deſire propoſeth unto it. Yet I will not ſay that Joy and Grief move to that height in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. No, it is impoſſible that either of them can be very great by reaſon of the ſtiffening of the Soul which hinders their motion; but this ſignifies that if when ſtrong they are compatible together, they may more eaſily be ſo when they are weakened; and conſequently Frowardneſs which commonly accompanies Conſtancy, and is but the commencement of Sadneſs, may ſubſiſt with that gayity which is often obſerved in this Paſſion; not but that tranſports and raviſhments of Joy may cauſe ſoundings and faintings of Grief; neither is there then any Conſtancy left, and in that very moment the Appetite muſt releaſe it ſelf to follow the violence of thoſe Paſſions. It's true that ſhe afterwards ſtiffens herſelf, but yet it would be but an interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſtancy, and which continues but by ſeveral efforts which are ſometimes ſo quick, that the Paſſions which interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, confounded themſelves with this, as we have ſaid it often happens in all the reſt of them.</p>
                        <p>For the reſt, from the inſenſibility which
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47499:300"/>ſhe hath for the ills of another,
<note place="margin">She is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to all.</note> and from the ſeverity ſhe takes in the uſe of goods, an <hi>Indifferency</hi> ſprings which ſhe is ſubject unto; foraſmuch as he who is not touched with thoſe ills which he ſees others ſuffer, and reſiſts all the pleaſures of life, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly free from all thoſe things which may the moſt powerfully ſtop the Mind and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it in the duties of civil ſociety: we are not from him to expect the ſweets of friendſhip, nor thoſe ſuccors which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion promiſeth to thoſe that are miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the good and ill of particulars and of the publick are indifferent to him, ſo that rendring himſelf uſeleſs to all the world, he becomes rude, auſtere and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage.</p>
                        <p>Theſe indeed are thoſe vices which have been obſerved in the Sect of the Stoicks, who ſtudied nothing but to exerciſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; ſince all their Philoſophy conſiſted to abſtain, and to ſuſtain, which are the two employments this Paſſion is deſtinated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; ſo that it is no wonder if they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe defects which uſually follow her when we uſe her not as we ought. Yet we muſt obſerve that the indifferency we ſpeak of reſpects not thoſe things which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is not tied unto; for if ſhe oppoſe a difficulty, ſhe hath no indifferency for it.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47499:300"/>On the contrary, ſhe ſtiffens herſelf, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionates and obſtinates herſelf againſt it; but beyond that, all is indifferent to her, and ſhe cares neither what may happen nor what concerns the reſt.</p>
                        <p>And again,
<note place="margin">She is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and content.</note> it's for the ſame reaſon that ſhe always appear <hi>Equal and Content,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as that indifferency which ſhe hath for all things, ſhe hath no deſires nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for them, and is exempt from thoſe cares and diſquiets which thoſe Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons breed; add hereunto that equally ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fening herſelf at the encounter of goods and of ills, good and ill fortune finde her always in the ſame plight, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried away by that, or being caſt down by this, ſhe always remains in one poſture, and ever appears like herſelf.</p>
                        <p>But we have ſtrayed too long to finde Reaſons, which are eaſie to be drawn from the principles we have eſtabliſhed, and which preſent themſelves unto the Mind as ſoon as a man would but know them. Let's turn to thoſe Characters which this Paſſion imprints on the Body.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall not be much troubled in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, there being but few whereof we have not ſpoken in the former Diſcourſe, ſince in the Chapter of Boldneſs we have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the cauſes of an aſſured Look, of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47499:301"/>the motion of the Lids and Brows, of ſilence, of coldneſs of the face, and of the retention of the breath, as in the Chapter of Hope we have obſerved, whence was the ſtrength of the Voice and of the Pulſe, why the Face changed not its colour, why the Head and Stature were ſtreight; for Conſtancy hath theſe effects common with them, and uſeth the ſame motives and the ſame means which they employ to produce them; we ſhall only remark ſome little differences, which are to be encountred in them.</p>
                        <p>For it's certain,
<note place="margin">What the Looks are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</note> that this <hi>Aſſured Look</hi> is here formed with a large opening of the Lids, a firm Sight, and with vivacity: But its vivacity is not ſo great as in Boldneſs, becauſe that in the deſign which this hath to aſſault ill, ſhe drives the Spirits out, and ſo abundantly fills the Eyes with them, that they become altogether ſparkling; inſtead of which Conſtancy, which ſtands upon the defenſive, ſtiffens them only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out driving them forth with impetuoſity, ſo that ſhe renders the Eyes quick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſtops the Spirits which give them force and vigor; but they gliſter not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come not thither in any quantity, and that they want that active motion which makes them gliſter and ſparkle. On the other ſide, this firmneſs of ſight is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47499:301"/>accompanied with a certain ſeverity which is not to be found in Hope, becauſe the Soul conſiders here onely the Ill, the preſence whereof makes her peeviſh, and that even there ſhe looks on the Good, the expectation whereof ſweetens the pain which ſprings from the difficulties which ſhe encounters.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Brows are lifted up,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">What kinde of motion the Brows have.</note> it's onely the better to behold the Enemy, and not to help the raſing up of the Soul, as it happens in Boldneſs; For which cauſe they lift not themſelves up ſo much nor ſo often as in that Paſſion; becauſe the Soul keeping herſelf firm and ſtiff to defend herſelf, ſollicites not the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to make thoſe great and frequent ſallyes which follow that impetuoſity which ſhe ſuffers herſelf to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way withall in aſſaulting. So that ſhe lifts up the Brows no more then the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the ſight requires, and not to ſerve the motion wherewith ſhe is agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated: She alſo repreſſeth them for the ſame reaſon as in Boldneſs. For ſhe thinks herſelf fortified when ſhe hath provided for the ſecuring of her Eyes, as hath been ſhewed in the former Chapter. But it ſometimes happens that in the ſtrongeſt aſſaults of Ills, ſhe keeps them unmovable,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47499:302"/>and that a Conſtant Man will ſee the greateſt dangers, and ſuffer moſt cruel pains without bending his Brow. Now this comes either from his great attention in conſidering the ill; for it makes him the more to open his eyes, and conſequently to lift up his Brows, which then cannot be reſtrained; or from the confidence he hath of his forces, which defends him from thinking on ſuch ſmall precautions; or from the deſign he hath by this outward immobility to make it appear that his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is not to be ſhaken.
<note place="margin">What his Silence is.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Silence</hi> is not here <hi>fierce and diſdainful</hi> as it is in Boldneſs, becauſe fierceneſs and diſdain are effects of Pride, which are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be found in true Conſtancy; But it's <hi>modeſt and ſerious,</hi> and proceeds meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the attention the Soul is in for to defend herſelf, and from the confidence ſhe hath of her own ſtrength; for that makes her forget words, and this defends them, ſince, as we have already ſaid, they are arms of weakneſs.</p>
                        <p>As for the reſt of the Characters which we have now ſpoken of, ſuch as are the coldneſs of the Face, the ſtrength of the Voice and Pulſe, holding the Breath, having the Head and Stature erect, there is no difference neither in their effect nor in their
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47499:302"/>cauſe, from thoſe which accompany Hope and Boldneſs, for which cauſe we ſend back the Reader to thoſe places where we have carefully obſerved them, and where it doth appear, that if they follow thoſe two Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it's becauſe they are always upheld by Conſtancy, and ſtrength of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
                        <p>But if ſhe hath ſuch a contexture and conformity with them,
<note place="margin">Why Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy hath not the reſt of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Hope.</note> why hath ſhe not alſo all their other Characters? Certainly it's becauſe beſides the ſtifneſs which they give the Soul, they inſpire alſo other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are not to be found in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for Hope indeed ſtiffens it ſelf againſt difficulties, but at the ſame time ſhe aſpires to the good which ſhe ſeeks, and ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſome help which may deliver her up the poſſeſſion, which makes her unquiet and impatient; ſhe ſighs and caſts up her eyes, which happens not in Conſtancy, becauſe ſhe hath no other deſign but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Ill. The ſame happens in Boldneſs, which ſtiffens it ſelf alſo to ſtrengthen it ſelf, but beſides that darts it ſelf forth, and throws it ſelf on the Enemy. So that all what follows this darting forth belongs not to Conſtancy, which when ſhe is alone never ſuffers this agitation; ſo the thorow Looks, the widening of the Noſtrils, the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47499:303"/>thunder of the Voyce, the fierceneſs of the Countenance, a vehement reſpiration, the redneſs and heat of the parts, and the like, which proceed from the raiſing up of the Soul, and from the violence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is agitated, are not to be met withal in all in that Conſtancy which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from thoſe great ſtorms. It's true, that its Pace is like that of Boldneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in ſtiffening herſelf, ſhe makes the Body weighty and march the more heavily. But ſhe balanceth it not as that doth, foraſmuch as ſhe hath not that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity which cauſeth the ſhoulders to turn inwardly, in which this ballancing of the body chiefly conſiſts, and this bold Gate. We may ſay as much of the Poſt which is Noble without Pride; for the Head is lifted up without any fierceneſs, the Stature is ſtreight without lifting up the Shoulders, and the motion of all the parts without conſtraint or violence is equal and modeſt: Now all this is conformable to that condition which the Soul is in in this Paſſion, for that in ſtiffening herſelf ſhe ſtiffens the parts alſo, which conſequently become ſtreight, and that this poſture is moſt ſafe, and leaſt expoſed to injuries, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe can the better ſee the enemy, and is every way the readier to reſiſt him. But the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47499:303"/>fierceneſs of the Countenance, the lifting up of the Shoulders, which are principal marks of Pride, as ſhall be ſhewn in its place; they are to be found therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soul nor ought, nor can extend or lift it ſelf up, nor make any violent motion being ſtiffened as ſhe is.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſtifneſs of the Body and parts</hi> is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and particular effect of this Paſſion;
<note place="margin">When com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                              </gap> ſtiffneſs of the Body.</note> for if it be in ſome other of them, we may ſay that it's by her means, and becauſe that ſhe accompanies them; but ſhe employs it not when ſhe is to reſiſt any thing which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal; otherwiſe ſhe abuſeth herſelf, and makes a uſeleſs endeavor, as hath been ſaid. Now to know wherein this ſtifneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and how it's made, we muſt obſerve beſides what hath been ſaid hereupon in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, That a thing may be two ways ſtiff; either becauſe it reſiſts the touch, or that it cannot be ſtaggered; now it may reſiſt the touch by being hard; and it's hard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe it's dry and ſolid, as a ſtone; or becauſe it's extended as a Baloon, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its parts are ſhut up and gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as thoſe are which are preſt and crowded; neither can it be ſhaken, either becauſe its weighty, or becauſe it hath a motion contrary to that which would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it. Thus a Column ſtands firm on its
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47499:304"/>own weight, a building ſupports it ſelf by its props and buttereſſes, the Members ſtiffen themſelves being equally drawn by the oppoſing muſcles, which being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it's certain that Conſtancy uſeth all theſe means to ſtiffen the parts, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that hardneſs onely which comes from drineſs, foraſmuch as there needs a long time to produce that quality. Yet muſt we make ſome diſtinction, for that ſome ſtiffen themſelves in one way, others in another; the Spirits and the Members which move voluntarily become firm by the oppoſition of their motions, the Muſcles by compreſſion, the Body by its weight and props, which we muſt particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>
                        <p>We have ſhewn how the Spirits ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen themſelves, and how they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their ſtifneſs to the parts; but there is this difference, That the ſtiffening of the Spirits comes from the contrariety of motions, and that which is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is performed by their upholding of them; for being ſtiffened, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be that they ſupport the parts which touch them, eſpecially if they be fluid as the Humors are.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Members which are deſtined for voluntary motion, as the Head, the Eyes,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47499:304"/>the Arms, and the Legs render themſelves alſo ſtiff by the contrariety of motions; for being compoſed of ſeveral Muſcles, ſome of which cauſe them to move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and others downwards, ſome to the right hand, ſome to the left, when they are all agitated at once, they muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main firm and ſtiff and without going ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and then they muſt ſuffer that motion which is called Tonick, which is the moſt violent of all, and which makes us moſt weary. For which cauſe we are more weary ſtanding upright then walking up and down; and it's more troubleſom to look long upon a fixed and ſettled look, or continually to keep ones Arms ſtiff, then if we uſed them to different motions, becauſe that all the Muſcles agitate therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any reſt; and herein there is but a part engaged, which reſts alſo when the other is in action.</p>
                        <p>Every muſcle in particular grows ſtiff when its work operates, but that is becauſe it grows hard; now it hardens by preſſing and contracting the parts together; for having no other action but to contract and ſhut up it ſelf, to bring towards it the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers it ought to move, it muſt needs take up leſs room, and therefore its parts muſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47499:305"/>be the more ſtreightned, whence this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes. Which although it happens out of neceſſity, forbears not alſo to be ſought for by the Soul, as a thing which may render the body ſtronger, and the leſs expoſed to injuries; and it is for the ſame reaſon, that the skin of Animals ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens it ſelf, when they will defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whence it follows that their hair and feathers ſtand on end, as we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where declared.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this ſtifneſs, the Muſcles and the skin may alſo acquire another by ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But becauſe there are two ſorts of it, the one which is made by drawing ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe things which may be extended as a rope or parchment; the other of filling them with ſome body, as a baloon; it's certain, that Conſtancy cannot render thoſe parts firm and ſtrong by this, but onely by the former. And this happens when the Muſcles cauſe a member to bend very much; for thoſe which are oppoſed to them, and which do not agitate are conſtrained to lengthen out and extend themſelves; and by this extention they become firm, and ſo render the skin hard. It's thus, that this Paſſion ſometimes <hi>extends the hands,</hi> that the inſide which they oppoſe to the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47499:305"/>danger, may become harder, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more fit to reſiſt ill.</p>
                        <p>As for the Body, it grows ſtiff not onely when all its parts are ſtiffened, but alſo by the ſupport and weight which it giveth it ſelf. Now it may be upheld by ſome exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or prop; for the Soul which puts it ſelf on the defenſive, ſeeks both in and out of it ſelf all what can ſtiffen it. So that when a man is aſſaulted, he who hath ſomewhat at his back to ſtay him up and help to ſupport him againſt the effort of his enemy, may make the better reſiſtance. The body alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds it ſelf by the ſituation and poſture which it takes; for by advancing a foot, or widening a little the legs, it makes for it ſelf, as it were, a prop or a buttereſs to ſupport it ſelf, which hinders it from being overturned on that ſide it reſts on. Add alſo how it alſo enlargeth its Baſis, and doth that which Art ordains for great pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are better upheld, the larger and greater the pedeſtal is. Laſtly, by making it ſelf weighty, its leſs ſubject to be ſhaken, becauſe that augmenting its weight, it the better reſiſts the motion of thoſe things which beat againſt it, and ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it more firm and more ſtable in its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. But how can it make it ſelf heavy?
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47499:306"/>Certainly, it is not that it hath more weight then it had, but it is that it makes it more efficient by the motion which it gives it ſelf; for weighty things have much more ſtrength, and make incomparably a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impreſſion when they are moved; when the Body therefore ſtiffens it ſelf, it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens all the ſuperior parts on the lower, and thoſe preſſing the earth, by the motion of the Muſcles, which are deſtined for that purpoſe, they make an effort which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the force of the weight which they ſuſtain, and ſo render the Body more firm, and leſs eaſie to be ſhaken.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe motions this Paſſion em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys alſo that of the Hands, to oppoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the ſhock ſhe is threatened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; for as they are parts deſtined to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the body, ſhe freely expoſeth them, and hazards them to ſave it from danger, and uſeth them as Barriers to ſtop the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or as a Buckler to receive the aſſaults, for which cauſe ſhe opens them that ſhe may cover and defend a greater ſpace; ſhe <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends</hi> them to render them ſtronger and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſhe <hi>advanceth</hi> them that ſhe may break and dead the violence of the blows, which ſhe cannot hinder from falling on it.</p>
                        <p>This is what we had to ſay of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47499:306"/>of Conſtancy; for the reſt which we have obſerved in its deſcription, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto her onely by reaſon of thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ſometimes mix themſelves with her. So Cries, Sighs, Tears, Groans, the weakneſs of the Body, proceed all from Pain; Indignation, Threatnings, Blows fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Boldneſs or Anger. The ſweetneſs of the Eyes, the gayneſs of the Countenance ariſe from the contentment which Love, Deſire and Hope propoſe.</p>

                        <p>ALthough Anger be a flame which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture kindles in the ſoul of all Animals,
<note place="margin">The Elogy of Anger.</note> and that it may be compared to that fire which ſhines in the Stars, for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Univerſe; It's ſtrange that it's almoſt never conſidered but as a frightful Comet, which declares and produceth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fire and ſword; and that Humane Reaſon ſhould be ſo unjuſt as always to condemn a Paſſion which always fights for Reaſon and for Juſtice: Yes without doubt, ſince ſhe is onely raiſed in the Soul to repel injuries, and to chaſtiſe thoſe ſhe believes have unjuſtly offended her, we may boldly ſay, that ſhe never arms herſelf but againſt Violence, and ever ſides with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Equity.</p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:47499:307"/>
                        <p>It is not but that men which abuſe all the moſt uſeful preſents of Nature, do often make it ſerve evill deſigns; but beſides that, to judge according to Reaſon of the price and value of things, we muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult concerning the abuſes which are found in them, nor the ill uſe which may be made of them. It's certain, that when ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt unjuſt, ſhe hath motives which ſeem equitable, that ſhe muſt at leaſt have the appearance of Juſtice to oblige her to take arms; and that if ſhe be deceived therein, it is not ſhe that is to be accuſed, but rather Malice and Error, who call her to their releif: As we do not blame Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who are of a Princes Guard when they follow him in temerous enterpriſes; and that it's ſometimes the duty of a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to obey a Tyrant; neither muſt we condemn Anger which was ſubmitted to Reaſon to ſerve for its guard and defence, when ſhe follows it in its irregularities, and obeys its orders how unjuſt ſoever they be. In a word, it is not in corruption we are to ſeek the purity of Anger; we muſt go back to its ſource, and enquire in the firſt channels wherein it runs, if it hath Vertues and Qualities uſeful for life, and worthy the praiſe we have given it.</p>
                        <p>If it be then true, that ſhe comes from
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47499:308"/>Nature, and that this Nature is nothing elſe but the Art of God, and the effuſion of his goodneſs and wiſdom in all his works: we muſt not doubt that ſhe is not ſenſible of ſo excellent an origine, and but that the admirable motions of this Paſſion are raiſed by the ſame ſpirit which animates and rules the Univerſe; It's what would imprint in all Creatures the image of his power, and render them as near as poſſible like unto him, which hath ſigned in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals the ſtrokes of his Juſtice, and hath given them the knowledge of the wrong which may be done them, and the juſt deſire they have of revenging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>And truly, as if it were the laſt touch which were to finiſh their perfection, and his liberality, it ſeems that there was more care employed to inſpire this Paſſion in them, then for any whatſoever. That there is none which it hath made ſo common and ſo natural; and that all the reſt are particular to ſome one, or ſo imperfect that it's dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to finde them therein. Love and Pleaſure indeed, which ſeem to be the moſt neceſſary and the moſt general, are hardly to be remarked in the moſt part of Beaſts; Boldneſs is onely to be found in thoſe which are ſtrong and couragious; Fear
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47499:308"/>ſurpriſeth onely thoſe which are weak; and even there are thoſe which are ſo fit for certain ages, and for ſome conditions, that they ſeldom paſs to others: But it is not ſo with Anger, which makes it ſelf be reſented by all in general; the leaſt ſuffer its eſmotions as well as the greateſt, and the weak as well as the ſtrong, and there are none which are not provided with arms which may ſerve for their revenge. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe knows no priviledges, and makes no difference amongſt men; ſhe agitates Children, as old Men; ſick, as ſhe doth the ſound; poor, as rich; Kings, as ſhe doth the Subjects; and without confining herſelf, as the reſt do, to ſome particulars, ſhe animates Families, Nations and whole Kingdoms. But as in the order of Nature, the moſt neceſſary things are, the more common they are; we muſt beleeve that this Paſſion ſhould not have been ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſperſed in all Animals, had it not been moſt important and moſt neceſſary for their preſervation; and that it would not have been ſo ſenſible, and ſo imperfect in all thoſe which are moſt imperfect, were it not moſt profitable and of greater uſe then all the reſt, which for the moſt part are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed and confuſed in them.</p>
                        <p>And certainly ſince all have far more ills
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47499:309"/>to fear, then goods to deſire, and that ill it ſelf is more powerful to deſtroy, then good is to preſerve; it was from the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of him, who expoſed them to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers, to give them ſtronger Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ſafeguard themſelves, then for to ſeek what was for their uſe; ſince it was more advantagious to overcome ill then to flie from it, and that all could not have the Boldneſs deſtined to conquer it: It muſt needs I ſay be, that to ſupply this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he muſt have inſpired another Paſſion to warm the courage of the weakeſt, and ſtir up the forces of the moſt timerous to engage them to fight thoſe Enemies which flight or patience would have rendred ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, ſince they were all to defend themſelves, not onely from ſuch as do ill unwittingly, but alſo from thoſe who do it out of malice: It was fit they ſhould have lights to diſcern them, and means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not onely their power but alſo their ill deſigns; for it had not been ſufficient to have provided for their ſecurity, if after having overcome them they could not have bereft them alſo of the deſire of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up arms again, and of convincing their unjuſt untertakings.</p>
                        <p>It's therefore Anger which cauſeth them
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47499:309"/>to get the better of ſuch dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which ſtop the courſe of their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and making them loſe the will of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, tear up ill by the roots, and ſhelter themſelves from whatſoever they might fear. And indeed Revenge which this Paſſion employs to that purpoſe hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but to chaſtiſe him that offends, that the puniſhment he ſuffers make take from him the deſire to continue the injury, and that he who hath received it may not again fall into the like danger. Is there any thing in the world ſo equitable and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary? Is there any thing wherein the providence of Nature is more reſplendent? And were it not to be ungrateful towards it to ſlight ſo uſeful a relief, and to condemn ſo juſt a defence?</p>
                        <p>For we muſt not believe that none but Beaſts may lawfully make uſe of it, that it is incompatible with Reaſon, &amp; that its never kindled in man, but that at the ſame time it extinguiſheth that divine light which in all its actions ought to enlighten it. No, no, it is in us, and for the ſame purpoſe, and for the ſame neceſſity that it is in the reſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals; we have the ſame enemies which they have, we are expoſed to the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and the cares for our own ſafeguard can be no leſs innocent then theirs are;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47499:310"/>whatever we may ſay, Reaſon and Anger are not in the number of thoſe Stars which never look on, or meet with one the other without imparting their vertue or bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or cauſing ſome troubles in the world. On the contrary they fortifie one another when they are united, and their conjuction breeds that celeſtial light in the Soul which raiſeth up thoſe languiſhing vertues, which give heat to thoſe which fight, and inſpires them with that divine fury with which they are animated againſt Vice. Whence can you fanſie proceeds that noble Indignation which the Soul conceives for unjuſt things, but from that Anger which cannot ſuffer injuſtice without an alarm? Whence ſprings that vertuous Frowardneſs, and that holy Impatience which ſeiſeth upon us at the ſight of crimes, but from this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hath no other care but to chaſtiſe the Authors of them? And whence can that juſt Deſpight come wherewith Vertue is provoked at the encounter of ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as croſs her, but from the ſame ſource whence ſhe draws thoſe forces which are neceſſary for to overcome them? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the moſt excellent Vertues would at every moment be leſſened, were they not raiſed up by this Paſſion: Juſtice would never proceed to revenge crimes with that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47499:310"/>zeal wherewith ſhe is ſo often tranſported, did ſhe not call it to her aſſiſtance. Valor would very rarely produce thoſe great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which render it formidable, were it not ſollicited by it. In a word, there is none to whom ſhe is not as a ſpur to advance them in the way of glory; and he that would bereave civil life of her, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly leave in it onely Weakneſs, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, and Cowardlineſs.</p>
                        <p>But notwithſtanding theſe great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, we muſt at laſt confeſs, it is the moſt to be feared of all the Paſſions, as that which cauſeth the greateſt diſorders in the world: By a ſtrange miſhap, ſcarce concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, the commerce it hath with Reaſon, inſtead to render it more perfect, hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it; and innocent as ſhe was in Beaſts, ſhe is become criminal in men; So that we may ſay ſhe is in ſome manner like the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors of the Earth, which change into thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and ſtorms when they come near the Sun; and that if ſhe did not riſe into the higheſt Region of the Soul, ſhe could never be able to produce thoſe thunders and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, which have cauſed ſo many publike calamities, and have deſolated ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and ſo many Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>For we muſt not believe that the ill it doth, falls onely on ſome particulars, as
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47499:311"/>that which proceeds from the Anger of Beaſts, and from the moſt part of humane Paſſions; beſides that it renders Cities and whole Nations furious, it never ſtrikes one perſon onely, but the blow threatens and offends all civil Society: For which cauſe the Laws which often tolerate the ill uſe of the reſt of the Paſſions, have never ſuffered that of Anger, how juſt ſoever it were; they ever reſerved the revenging of injuries; and whoſoever hath uſurped that power, commits a crime juſtly to be reſented, and hath moſt commonly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the infamy of the puniſhment, the ſhame of the outrage. In effect, they could not have left to particulars a power which onely belongs to the publick, and put the arms of Juſtice into the hands of a furious perſon, without abandoning the life and fortune of all men to inſolency and cruelty, and without breaking thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bonds which unite them together in the forms of Communities and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
                        <p>But what ſeverity ſoever hath been practiſed, what reſtraint ſoever they have bridled this wilde and untameable Paſſion withal, they could never hinder it from bringing diſorder and confuſion where ever it came. It hath made the wiſeſt loſe their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47499:311"/>Judgment and their Reaſon, brought confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion amongſt the beſt friends, filled the moſt illuſtrious families with blood and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and we may ſay that the earth reaks every where ſtill with the broils it hath raiſed in the greateſt Cities, and in the faireſt Provinces. Thoſe things which were ever had in veneration amongſt men, are violated by this inſolent Paſſion, which tramples under foot all the reſpects which Nature inſpires with our lives; and its impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety raiſeth it ſelf even againſt Heaven, and againſt the Divinity it ſelf. In fine, if we ſhould ſpeak all the ill it cauſeth, perhaps we ſhould learn all the ill which is done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. But the better to ſhew the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it cauſeth, we need but repreſent a man who hath ſuffered himſelf to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with theſe exceſſes, and conſider the ſtrange change which it makes in his Minde and in his Countenance.</p>
                        <p>Anger is none of thoſe Paſſions which ſweetly inſinuates it ſelf into the ſoul,
<note place="margin">Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man in Anger.</note> which flatters it at firſt, and by weak beginnings takes from it the ſuſpition of its violence; it enters with impetuoſity and with open arms; or to ſpeak better, it enters it not; it falls like thunder which ſtrikes unawares, and there is no diſtinction of time between its fall and the burnings it cauſeth; for as
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47499:312"/>ſoon as a man is poſſeſt with it he perceives himſelf inflamed with deſpight and diſdain. Vengeance like a torrent of fire diſperſeth it ſelf in all its thoughts; Fury prevails over his Reaſon and his Judgment, and like a devouring flame it runs and crackles in his Veins, it ſparkles in his Eyes, thunders in his words; they are nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, reproaches, and injuries; nothing but threatnings, and imprecations, and blaſphemies. The more ſweetneſs and weakneſs he naturally hath, the more ſharp and impetuous his Paſſion is, the more ſtormy and inſolent. Neither reſpects nor conſiderations can reſtrain him; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth neither Maſters, nor Friends, nor Parents; Silence provokes him, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes commit an outrage, and often inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency it ſelf is no leſs inſufferable then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</p>
                        <p>As if he minded nothing but to torment himſelf, he is not able to hear any reaſon which might calm the diſturbance he is in, but he is very ingenious to find out all thoſe which may encreaſe it: He fancies the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence greater then indeed it is; he remarks the leaſt circumſtances that may aggravate it; and if it happens that words and effects offend him not in the tone of the voice, or in the motions of the Eyes, he findes great
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47499:312"/>cauſes of wrath and revenge. Neither doth he ſtop there, he calls to mind all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good offices he hath done his Enemy, and the ill uſage he hath received from him; even thoſe actions which were before indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to him, do then ſeem injurious; the ſmalleſt of his faults appear ſenſible affronts and bitter injuries: And being aſtoniſhed that he foreſaw not his ill deſigns, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth himſelf of impudence and of ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and adds to his firſt fury the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſpight which he conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf: Whereupon after having made his reſentment ſparkle by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy of his diſcourſe, and by all thoſe exclamations which grief and rage drive forth, he all at once falls into a profound ſilence, and walking with large paces, with a wilde and frightful mind, by the frequent ſhakings of the Head, and by the grinding of the Teeth, and by his furious Looks he declares that he revolves in his mind the deſigns of ſome great and terrible revenge. In effect, there is no ill which a man could make his enemy ſuffer, which preſents not it ſelf to his deſires; infamy, puniſhments, tortures, are the ſweeteſt chaſtiſements he prepares for him; the ſword and poiſon are the meaneſt inſtruments which he means to employ; he thinks which blows may
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47499:313"/>be the rudeſt to be inflicted, what places are moſt ſenſible, what death might be moſt cruel. And to glut his rage, he propoſeth to himſelf nothing leſs then to ſtrangle him himſelf, to tear in peeces, and to feed on his very Heart and Bowels. After a thouſand ſuch like deſigns which moſt commonly deſtroy one the other, he would that ſome diſorder might happen in Nature for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that the earth would open and ſwallow him up, that the plague might ſtifle him, that he might be thunder-ſtruck. Finally, he makes vows for his ill fortune that they may ſupply his own impotency, and ſollicites the wrath of Heaven and Hell to perfect the puniſhment which he hath commenced. But ſhould all this happen, yet would not he be ſatisfied unleſs all men did believe that it was he who was the cauſe of all theſe mſchiefs, that he drew them on his Adverſary, and that even he alſo ſuffers them far rather for his particular ſatisfaction, then for the chaſtiſement of his crime.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt he feeds his Paſſion with theſe cruel thoughts, we hear long and ſcalding ſighs which at every moment are fetched from the bottom of his Soul; confuſed and interrupted words, which from time to time eſcape his fury; and the noiſe he
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47499:313"/>makes by beating all what he meets with under hand or feet. At laſt breaking out of his ſilence, he deteſtss, he threatens, he blaſphemes and diſcovers all what he hath on his heart, and betraying his ſecret, he renders the revenge which he meditated of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſeleſs, ſometimes pernitious.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are near upon the motions he hath in the abſence of his enemy, but this is nothing in reſpect of thoſe which he ſuffers in his preſence. At firſt it ſeems as if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to ſhun his encounter, as if he were unwilling to ſee him, and in a proud and diſdainful way turning his back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he grumbles, he murmurs, and forms betwixt the teeth words of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of diſdain. But he remains not long in that condition; the flame growing more violent when it's ſhut up; his wrath is provoked by this reſtraint, and changing it ſelf altogether into fury, it tranſports him out of himſelf, and renders him like a wilde and furious beaſt; he cries out, he runs, he ſtrikes, and without fear or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the danger he caſts himſelf through fire and ſword, he drives his friend into them, and cares not to loſe what is moſt dear unto him, ſo as he may loſe him who hath offended him. Like one in deſpair, he throws himſelf into a precipice that he
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47499:314"/>may draw him therein along with him; he ſeeks ſhipwrack ſo as he might periſh with him; he calls him to fight, wherein the chance of Arms is doubtful; and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ardor he hath to revenge himſelf, bereaves him of his revenge; all his skill and addreſs is then uſeleſs, moſt of his blows are vain, he hath no ward againſt thoſe which are given him; he blindly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf to danger, and like thoſe ruines which break themſelves on what they fall, he often locks himſelf in the arms of him whom he caſts down.</p>
                        <p>If it happen that he hath the advantage, and that he thinks he hath ſatisfied his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he adds inſolency to cruelty; he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth his enemy conquered as he is, he laugheth at his misfortune, and feeding his eyes on the ſlaughter which he hath made, he feels a certain malignant joy break forth in his heart, which afterward diſperſeth it ſelf over his face, and which he makes appear in all his actions. But if he believes that he is not revenged, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairs, he rageth, he accuſeth inſenſible things, his Friends, God, and himſelf; he breaks his ſword for not having given the deſired blow, he is angry with thoſe who would have appeaſed him, he ſtrikes the ground, he rails againſt Heaven, he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47499:314"/>beats his own face, and tears his hair; at laſt when he cannot hurt the perſon, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults the reputation; his enemy hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which he publiſheth not, he bringeth the vices of his Anceſtors out of their graves, and if truth cannot furniſh him with reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and injuries, he borrows them from lyes and calumnies. In a word, to deſcribe all the actions of a man in his wrath, we muſt fancy, all what temerity, cruelty and fury can effect.</p>
                        <p>Not that all thoſe who are touched with this Paſſion, ſuffer themſelves to be carried away to this exceſs: There are dumb and diſdainful Angers, there are thoſe which are quite vapored away in words; there are ſome that are weak and timorous, others that are noble and generous; and without doubt thoſe are not ſo extravagant as that which we now deſcribed: Yet there is none which raiſeth not a great diſturbance in the mind, which drives not out of it ſweetneſs and humanity, and which bereaves not a man of the beſt part of himſelf. But we ſhall elſewhere ſpeak of all theſe kindes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; let's now ſee the effects which the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of this Paſſion commonly produceth on the Body.</p>
                        <p>It's moſt certain, that there is none which ſo ſtrangely alters the Face as this doth: There is no man whom Anger will not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47499:315"/>unknown both to his and to himſelf; his Eyes are red and inflamed, their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is peircing and rapid; ſometimes they look through, ſometimes they fix, and ſeem as if they would go out of their places; we may obſerve a ſparkling drineſs in them, a wilde and ſavage diſquiet. The Eyebrow is ſometimes caſt down and ſometimes lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and after they reſtrain themſelves. The Forehead is wrinkled and gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Eyes, the Hair ſtands on end, the Noſtrils open and widen themſelves; the Lips thinken and lowr themſelves, they tremble, they preſs themſelves, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they form a cruel and diſdainful ſmile. He grinds his Teeth, he foams, he blows, his mouth grows dry, his breath ſtinking, his voice more vehement and ſharp then it was at firſt, at laſt becomes terrible, and ratling. It often ſtops all at once, and when it chanceth to form any words, the Tongue faulters, his words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere, and his diſcourſe is intangled: If he holds his tongue, it's an enraged ſilence, which at every moment is interrupted with ſighs, with groans, and the frightful out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries which he makes; his Face grows pale, inflames and ſwells; the veins of his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, of his Temples and Neck are ſwelled and extended; his Pulſe beats quick &amp; vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47499:315"/>his Breaſt which is redned is lifted up with great throbs, and he breaths with a violent and precipitate reſpiration. But who can deſcribe the ſhakings of the Head, the clappings of his Hands, the throwing about of his Arms, the trampling of his Feet, all his brisk and bold motions; In fine, that continual agitation, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Anger. It's ſufficient to ſay that his Countenance, his Minde, his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, is an aſſembling together of all what is moſt deformed in moſt cruel Sickneſſes, and of what is moſt horrible in the wildeſt of Beaſts. Let's now ſeek the cauſe of all theſe effects in the Nature of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>ALthough Philoſophy hath more ſpoken of Anger then of any of the Paſſions,
<note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to define Anger.</note> either becauſe it's more eaſily known, or becauſe its moderation is more important to a civil life then the reſt; yet neither hath it ſucceeded in the definition thereof, better then of thoſe which we have examined. For beſides that it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47499:316"/>not the motion proper for it, which is a part of its eſſence: it is in doubt what gender to give it, what object raiſeth it, and the true motive which it hath. Some indeed ſay it's an effect of vengeance; others that it is not an Appetite, but a riſing up of the Soul; ſome will have it the ſlighting of that object which moves it; others add thereto injury; otherſome there are who deny that vengeance is the true and proper motion of this Paſſion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they ſuppoſe, it pretends always to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it ſelf, and that Hatred hath often the ſame deſign without being adviſed by this.</p>
                        <p>In a word, of all the definitions which have been given it, there is not one which expreſſeth all the Nature of Anger, which leaves not other difficulties which are hard to be reſolved by thoſe principles which we commonly ſuppoſe in this buſineſs; and truly that of <hi>Alexander</hi> which ſeems to be the moſt exact, hath its defects as well as the reſt: For in ſaying that it's a deſire of vengeance, cauſed by the grief we have of ſeeing ones ſelf unjuſtly ſlighted; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Beaſts are not touched with ſcorn, who nevertheleſs are ſuſceptible of this Paſſion; there are a thouſand encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherein we may be provoked to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47499:316"/>without having cauſe to believe we have been ſlighted; as when we are angry with our ſelves, or againſt inſenſible things. If inſtead of this ſlighting you put Injury, the ſame difficulty remains entire; ſince it's very probable that Beaſts know not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, nor conſequently Injury; and that there are many things which make us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at which we cannot juſtly be offended. Add alſo, that a man may have the grief to ſee himſelf offended, and the deſire of being revenged without being angry; for the motion of Grief, and that of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which belongs to the Concupiſcible Appetite, ſeem not as if they ſhould enter into the eſſence of this Paſſion; beſides they ſhould tell us what Vengeance is, and why we deſire it; for if to revenge ones ſelf be nothing but to retort the ill on him who afflicted it, cauſing him to ſuffer the ſame pains: There is no likelihood that a man ſhould be angry with himſelf or inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, ſeeing no man would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on himſelf, and that it is impoſſible and uſeleſs againſt thoſe things that are without ſence.</p>
                        <p>To ſay likewiſe that it's a riſing in the Soul, whereby ſhe overcomes thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which traverſe her deſigns; This definition would be too general, ſeeing it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47499:317"/>befits alſo Boldneſs, and that therein the Soul may raiſe it ſelf without being moved by Anger; for I mind not thoſe who ſay that this riſing up is not an Appetite; ſince it's a received maxime, That all motion of the Appetitive part is called the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, the worſt of all thoſe, is that which raiſeth it to an ebullition or fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blood about the heart; for it it not therein that the eſſence of Anger conſiſts; that is only its effect; it being certain that all Paſſions are impermanent actions, which are formed in the Soul before ſhe agitates the Body, and principally the humors which are no parts of it.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the difficulties which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in common opinion; the method which we hold, and the principles which we have eſtabliſhed, render not the thing the more eaſie. For after having ſhewed that the Soul which will not flye before the enemy, hath but two courſes to take, to wit, Reſiſtance and Aſſault, which are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Boldneſs; it ſeems as if we had exhauſted all the ſprings whence An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might proceed, as if we were obliged to confound it with one or other of theſe two Paſſions. Indeed it raiſeth it ſelf up againſt ill, it aſſaults it, it would overcome
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47499:317"/>it, even as Boldneſs; ſo that they ſeem both to have but the ſame object, the ſame motive, and the ſame motion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be but one Paſſion, ſince theſe three things which make the difference of all the eſmotions of the Soul, render them equal, and every way alike.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſince it's undoubted that they are different, and that by experience we know there are ills which move Boldneſs and not Anger; that this is more impetuous and turbulent then the other, and that there are many perſons which are cholerick, as Children, Women, and thoſe that are ſick, which we cannot call Bold; there muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſome circumſtances, and ſome conditions in their cauſes which muſt make the difference; let's firſt therefore examine the matter and the object of this Paſſion, and conſider whether it be truly the ſame which raiſeth Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>In the former Diſcourſe we have ſhewn,
<note place="margin">What ill is Angers object.</note> That the word Ill did not onely ſignifie the effect which properly is ill, but alſo the cauſe which produceth it. And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is ſo neceſſary for the knowledge of the Paſſions, that there are ſome which have no other object but the ill it ſelf, as Grief; others which conſider onely the cauſe, as Anger, Hope, and Deſpair. Laſtly,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47499:318"/>others which confound them together, as Boldneſs, Hatred, Averſion, and Fear.</p>
                        <p>Now Anger aſſaults nothing but the cauſe onely of ill; for a man cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with an injury which he may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but with him who did it: Quite contrary, Boldneſs looks on the danger without often conſidering whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens.</p>
                        <p>But as there are cauſes which produce ill without knowledge, as others which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it without deſign, if we conſiderately examine thoſe which Anger aſſaults, we ſhall always finde them agitating with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for we are not provoked to anger againſt a ſtone which hurts us, but againſt him who threw it. And what ill ſoever we ſuffer, it will never raiſe this Paſſion, if we do not imagine that there is ſome cauſe which had an intention to make us ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it.</p>
                        <p>Yet becauſe he who chaſtiſeth with a purpoſe to do ill, doth not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Anger, there muſt be one kinde of ill proper to move this Paſſion, which being properly moved, may cauſe the Soul to riſe againſt that which is the cauſe thereof.</p>
                        <p>Others as we have already ſaid, will have it be Scorn; there being nothing more
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47499:318"/>powerful to provoke Anger, nor any ill which a man more impatiently ſuffers; yet ſince Children and Beaſts are not ſenſible of it, who nevertheleſs are often touched with this Paſſion; and that we every day ſee very many who patiently ſuffer Scorn, who are all in a fury if you do but take from them what they believe is their due. Finally, we are angry with our ſelves, with chance, with inſenſible things, by which we can no ways be deſpiſed; ſo that we muſt confeſs there muſt be ſome other ill which moves Anger.</p>
                        <p>Others will have it to be an Injury; men indeed are never ſo angry as againſt thoſe by whom they think they have been unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended. And when we think the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence hath been done without deſign, or believe that we have deſerved it, we no longer ſeek to revenge it. On the other ſide, it ſeems as if Beaſts cannot know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, ſince they know not unjuſt things: and ſo we muſt ſay that they are not ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of Anger, could injuries onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it.</p>
                        <p>But if we conſider that Children who have not the uſe of Reaſon, and whoſe knowledge is not much different from that of Beaſts, forbear not to know when they are unjuſtly offended; that a Lyon is not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47499:319"/>angry with a ſtone or a thorn which hurts it; that there are Beaſts fierce enough which in play ſuffer ill without ſeeking revenge, and are ſeldom angry with Children: It's very probable that there is ſome kinde of juſtice amongſt them, that they know there are ills which they ought not ſuffer, and that they know who offends them out of deſign; not that they have the knowledge of things ſo clear and ſo diſtinct as men may have; but the ſame inſtinct which guides them to their end without their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to arrive thereunto, affords them alſo the knowledge of the wrong which is done them, without diſcerning it. It's true, there is a great difference in this knowledge, and it's more or leſs perfect according as Creatures have more or leſs perfection. A Bee caſts out its ſting againſt a ſtone as well as againſt an Animal; but a Dog, unleſs he be furious will never aſſault any but him who purpoſely hath hurt him: Beaſts are therefore capable of knowing injuries, and therefore we may ſay, that there is no other ill but that which ought to move Anger.</p>
                        <p>Now there may be as many kindes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries as there are things which may unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend;
<note place="margin">Scorn is a great injury.</note> but amongſt us there is none which ſo commonly and generally doth it
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47499:319"/>as Deſpight. And Nature hath given ſo great an Averſion to the Mind of man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, it endures no ill whatſoever more impatiently then that, nor is it more eaſily or more violently born away by any to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; And this in my opinion, happens from that that Scorn is nothing elſe but the opinion which we have that a thing merits not conſideration, having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quality, and that we judge it can do neither good nor hurt; for we ought to honor excellent things, love thoſe which are profitable, and fear thoſe which are hurtful: ſo that thoſe are to be deſpiſed which deſerve not honor, and are capable of neither love nor fear: But beſids, that man is naturally a lover of himſelf, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of vengeance is born with him, and out of that conſideration he believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amiable, and that if he be offended he can be hurtful: he hath a ſecret ſence of the dignity of his being, and thinks that he commits an injuſtice who renders him not the honor which is due unto him. That to deſpiſe him is in a manner to conteſt the advantages which Nature hath given him. Finally, as there is no good which is more his own then that, there is alſo nothing which can tranſport him more then for any to ſeek take it away.</p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:47499:320"/>
                        <p>If this original excellency is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with thoſe which birth, ſtudy, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune may advance, ſuch as are the natural and acquired qualities of the Mind, the ſtrength and beauty of the Body, Honors, Riches, and Friends; it's then that the ſence of Scorn is more common, and moſt inſufferable, becauſe that thoſe who think to excel in any thing, believe alſo that there is honor due unto them, and that in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral occaſions many are wanting to give it them. Whence it happens that Great, Rich and Young men, thoſe who have many Friends, Honor, or Beauty, are eaſily moved to wrath; yet I alſo know that ſuch as are deprived of theſe excellent qualities, as are Poor, Old, and Sick perſons, in a word, all thoſe who have any defect are Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, beleeving at every moment that they are deſpiſed by reaſon of their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and although they think not that they ought to be eſteemed for them, yet they do beleeve it's to commit an injuſtice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be becauſe their defects ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve compaſſion rather then ſcorn, or whether every one thinks they have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtore of other good qualities to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ballance thoſe wants.
<note place="margin">Whence the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an injury.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now although the kind and the nature of the injury ought to render it more or leſs
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47499:320"/>ſenſible, yet neither is it that which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures its greatneſs: it's the opinion alone of him that ſuffers it; for how great ſoever the offence may be, it would never kindle Anger unleſs we acknowledge and reſent it. And often an indifferent thing will grow to a groſs injury, if we but imagine it to be ſo. Now there are two cauſes which may form this opinion; Truth, and Error; this comes from the precipitation and weakneſs of the Mind, which commonly follows the temperature and cuſtom; wherefore Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Women and ſick people are eaſily moved; whereas a judicious and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man ſeldom grows angry. As for the Truth, it proceeds from the juſt value we have of the offence, examining the greatneſs of the ill, the perſons, the places, the times, and the cauſes; for if the ill be great indeed, if he who receives it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of quality, and he that offends is his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, or is obliged unto him in any kinde of duty, if it were in publick, if for a ſlight cauſe, or that malice was the onely motive, we cannot doubt but the reſentment muſt be the greater. In a word, the further he that offends errs from juſtice, and from his duty, ſo much greater effectually the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, and the eſmotion which it raiſeth up in the Mind, muſt alſo be the more violent.</p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:47499:321"/>
                        <p>He therefore who doth an injury is the object of Anger,
<note place="margin">Why it riſeth up againſt the cauſe of ill.</note> and the onely enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom it imploys all its efforts. Let's now enquire the reaſon why the Soul riſeth up againſt him, and the deſign ſhe hath when ſhe aſſaults him.</p>
                        <p>All the world is agreed, That it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge herſelf; for there is no body agitated by this Paſſion who reſpires not venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who ſpeaks not of it, and with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure executes it not, unleſs he be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>In effect, <hi>To revenge ones ſelf</hi> on any man, is to make him ſuffer a puniſhment proportionable to the ill he hath done; ſo God revengeth himſelf on the wicked by puniſhing them; the Laws revenge crimes by thoſe chaſtiſements which they ordain; and Men revenge particular injuries, by the ill which they inflict on thoſe which have offended them: Anger therefore hath no other deſign, but that it intends onely to ſeek ſatisfaction for the offence received, to chaſtiſe him who hath committed it, and to cauſe him to ſuffer an equal or pronorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable puniſhment to the ill which he hath done.</p>
                        <p>But what profit or benefit can accrew unto it by this chaſtiſement? For the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is done, is received, is reſented; and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47499:321"/>were there any remedy to be applied, it were to be employed for the taking away or ſweetning of the ill, and not againſt the cauſe which can nothing eaſe it, and can no ways undo what it hath done.</p>
                        <p>Were it true that this Paſſion had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object but Scorn, we might ſay that revenge were a neceſſary means to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtain and the ſhame, becauſe that doing ill to him who deſpiſeth us, we ſhould make him know that we were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſpicable, ſince ſcorn is nothing but the opinion which we have that a thing can do neither good nor hurt. But beſides that Scorn is not the univerſal object of Anger, the revenge it ſeeks hath a more general end then that; for we are not content to do ill to him who ſcorns us, to make him loſe that conceit, ſince there are other means to perſwade him to it, without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the deſire of our revenge; but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Revenge muſt be a puniſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this Paſſion ſeeks to chaſtiſe thoſe who offend it.</p>
                        <p>Now all pains and all chaſtiſements are the remedies which Juſtice employs againſt Malice; but throughly to examine them,
<note place="margin">What the motive and the end of chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is.</note> they are onely preſervative remedies. For although we ſay that the ill committed may be repaired by chaſtiſement, that the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47499:322"/>of Juſtice demands puniſhments for thoſe who have offended, as well as rewards for thoſe which have done well. And finally, That it's juſt that he who hath lift up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above that degree wherein the Law hath placed him, ſhould be caſt down by it, and ſuffer pains for the pleaſure he took in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Yet the queſtion remains ſtill unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, What the puniſhment doth againſt that fault which is committed, ſince it takes not away the ill which is done, nor the blemiſh or deformity it may have left in the Soul, ſince even thoſe ſufferings have not that power.</p>
                        <p>And truly all the difficulty is, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe puniſhments that God inflicts in the life to come; for as for thoſe which the natural and civil Law have preſcribed, we may ſay with the greateſt men of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they reſpect the future onely, having no other end then to make him better who did the ill, or to reſtrain others in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the example, or to provide for the ſafety of him who may be offended. But all theſe motives have no place in thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements which the wicked ſuffer after death, ſince they will then be no longer in a capacity to correct them, and that they laſt to eternity, wherein the example will be uſeleſs, and where thoſe whom they
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47499:322"/>would offend need no longer have any thing to fear.</p>
                        <p>What deſign therefore hath Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice propoſed it ſelf in thoſe long and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhments? For we muſt have a a care that we fall not into the error of thoſe who ſay, God hath no other deſign in puniſhing, but to puniſh; it were to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Wiſdom and his Juſtice, to make them act without being guided by that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Equity, which renders to every man according to his deſerts. It's true, that thoſe he puniſhes, deſerve to be puniſhed; but why do they deſerve it? becauſe they have offended him. And why doth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence deſerve puniſhment, ſince we cannot hinder the ill from having been done, and that the pain hath no proportion with the offence, nor with the ſatisfaction which God may require; there being no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that the ill which he inflicts on them can or ought to ſatisfie?</p>
                        <p>I know that in the deſign I have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to reſolve ſuch great difficulties by my particular ſentiments; ſome will ſay it's a great temerity to ſeek to fathom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of the Counſels and Judgments of God; that they are myſteries which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be adored with humility, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined with preſumption; and that thoſe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47499:323"/>who dare enquire after reaſons for their chaſtiſements, are in danger of ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as that Equitable Judge prepares for them. Moreover, if we are obliged to ſpeak of it, we muſt follow the already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Maxims, and go by the ordinary road, without taking by-ways, which in all ſuch caſes are always dangerous. But I ſhall oppoſe this advice onely with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and ſubmiſſion wherewith I undertake to ſpeak of things which are towards men ineffable and incomprehenſible: The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which this ſubject impoſeth on me to ſeek all the motives of puniſhments, that ſo I might find that which Anger propoſeth to its ſelf in Revenge, and the liberty which every man takes to ſpeak what he thinks on queſtions which admit of no certain deciſion: Whereupon I ſuppoſe I may with ſecurity propoſe my opinion hereupon, ſince others do not ſatisfie the difficulties which are to be found therein; and that even according to mine advice they do not ſufficiently make known that ſoveraign Equity which God obſerves in his judgements.</p>
                        <p>We may therefore ſay, That when God hath ordained Puniſhments, he conſidered the future no more then the civil Laws do, and had no other deſign but to keep men in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47499:323"/>their duty by the ſeverity of puniſhments, and to hinder them by the terror of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from offending him, and rendring themſelves unworthy of his grace. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this forewarning were uſeleſs, unleſs he executed what he hath ordained, he at laſt makes the guilty ſuffer the puniſhment wherewith he before had juſtly threatned them; not that he would thereby repair the ill committed, or ſatisfie the offence done him, but becauſe he is faithful and true; ſo that threatning and eſtabliſhment of the Law is a work of his Juſtice, which ought to hinder ill; but the execution is an effect of his faithfulneſs, which ought to maintain his Juſtice. For which cauſe when the holy Scripture, wherein we ought to learn the manner how we are to ſpeak of divine things, ſays that God is juſt, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly adds that he is true and faithful; all its pages are full of the fidelity of his Laws and of his Judgements; and when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the hiſtory of things which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen after they were foretold, it preciſely obſerves that they happened that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy might be fulfilled; As if the event were onely to render God in his word true and faithful, and to ſhew that his Juſtice and his Goodneſs cauſe him to make Laws and Decrees; but that after they are made,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47499:324"/>it's his fidelity which obligeth him to put them in execution.</p>
                        <p>And truly did Juſtice exact puniſhment, and that it were neceſſary to repair an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by its chaſtiſement, we could never be pardoned without offending Juſtice; and he who would remit the pain due to crimes, would remain reſponſible to the Juſtice which of right belongs unto it. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Clemency, Mercy, and Lenity how excellent ſoever thoſe Vertues are, would be uſeleſs, and contrary to reaſon. To avoid theſe inconveniencies, we muſt conclude, that it is not the Juſtice but the Fidelity of the Law which exacts puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo neither is pardon contrary to Juſtice; and if there be ought elſe which it ſeems to claſh withal, it's the Fidelity of the Law which the Legiſlator in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars may diſpence withal, ſince the Law is a floating general thing, which is not determined to any in particular. In effect, the Prince hath power to diminiſh or change chaſtiſements; he ſometimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers an innocent to ſuffer puniſhment for the guilty, and believes he hath ſatisfied the Law, when the puniſhment it ordained hath been executed on him, who imputed on himſelf the crime of the guilty.</p>
                        <p>Finally, this reaſon to me ſeems the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47499:324"/>more receivable, becauſe it eaſily reſolves that great difficulty which Theology hath always held of the eternity of pain; for to ſay that pain ought to be infinite, becauſe it reſpects an infinite object, this and all other reaſons which are commonly given, do not fully ſatisfie the Mind, and ſtill leave ſome doubt why Divine Juſtice ſhould exact an eternal puniſhment for a crime committed in a moment; what neceſſity is there the chaſtiſement ſhould be infinite, becauſe the object is infinite; and what ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction can God have of an offence which moſt commonly hurts onely him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it?</p>
                        <p>But if it be true, that God ordains pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments but for preſervative remedies, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that having impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eternal pains to hinder men from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him, he muſt inflict ſuch as he hath ordained, when they become guilty, or elſe he could not be faithful, and his forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be uſeleſs. Now it was fit to impoſe theſe pains; for unleſs men had been threatned with an eternal puniſhment, there had been no way to keep them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and for what time ſoever God had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited their pains, the hope of being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards releaſed would have encouraged them to ill; and with the little ſence they
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47499:325"/>had of another life, they would have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded millions of years for ſome moments of this, as they might have but contented their evil inclinations. It's certainly evident that a leſs ſeverity could not have been; ſince with all the terror which it gives, yet doth it not perform ſo full an effect as might have been hoped, and that no body can with reaſon complain of it, ſince thoſe who do well are not ſubject to it, and the guilty voluntarily ſubmit themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                        <p>When we have ſaid all, we muſt ſay of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment what is faid of Reward, ſince there is a proportion betwixt them; now it's certain that the Reward which we expect from heaven, is only grounded on the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Promiſes of God, and not on his abſolute Juſtice, which was no ways obliged to give us glory, which is a good which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth all natural capacity, which hath no proportion with created things, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we can pretend nothing, but altogether from the pure grace of the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which of our ſelves we can by no means deſerve.</p>
                        <p>But I ſhall yet go further, to conſider man in his natural condition; he cannot of right demand ſo much as any temporal reward unleſs it be by vertue of the promiſes made
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47499:325"/>unto him by divine and humane Laws; for beſides that vertue is ſatisfied in herſelf, and that the pleaſure which accompanies good actions, is the laſt perfection, and if we may ſo ſpeak, the only recompence they can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire unto; God is not obliged to give man more then to the reſt of the Creatures, but onely what is neceſſary for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preſervation of his being; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do men ow themſelves to one another, but as they are obliged to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the rigor of Juſtice; now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards before they were promiſed, are not of that order; they may paſs in the rank of Graces. For to render what is due is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence; it's a payment, and reward is ſomewhat more then payment: So when we pay a Servant for the ſervice he hath done we reward him not; to reward him, you muſt give him more then your obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bore, neither could your gift have been exacted for him by the rigor of Juſtice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by vertue of the promiſes which were made unto him: For which cauſe ſome have had reaſon to ſay, that Honor was not the reward of vertue, becauſe it's a right due to its excellency. It's true, that this duty hath its bounds and meaſures, beyond which it may paſs for a reward, as titles and badges of Honor are which Laws
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47499:326"/>and Princes beſtow on thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form fair actions, foraſmuch as they go beyond the obligation they have to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Vertue, and that they beſtow them not as things due out of neceſſity, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by vertue of their promiſes, whereby they oblige themſelves to recompence ſuch as performed ſuch like actions: thoſe alſo who perform them, render themſelves worthy of the effect of thoſe promiſes, and that is what we call to deſerve a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                        <p>Yet this imports not that promiſes which Princes and Laws make upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are not inſpired by Juſtice: it's the ſame as concerning thoſe pains wherewith they threaten thoſe who perform evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for as there are preſervative reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to hinder Vice, thoſe are as nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to entertain Vertue; and it's as juſt to encourage and provoke men to do well out of hope of reward, as to intimidate and withdraw them from ill by threatning of puniſhment; As alſo the exacting of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments is not the work of pure Juſtice, but of the fidelity of the Law; after the ſame manner, the reward a man receives is not an effect of Juſtice, but of the faithfulneſs of the promiſer; for that beſides that a vertuous action is out of duty and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47499:326"/>it can pretend to a reward only but as from an expectative grace; the Juſtice of the Law having conſidered the future one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and being not deſtined for things done, unleſs for example ſake, and to render the promiſes true and faithful.</p>
                        <p>But it's to carry the matter we treat too high; Let's ſatisfie our ſelves in ſaying, that what concerns puniſhments ordained by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and civil Laws, the greateſt men of antiquity have been of my opinion, and have beleived as we do, that they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſervative remedies deſtined to make thoſe better who have erred, to ſerve for an example to other men, and to provide for the ſecurity of thoſe who have been offended.</p>
                        <p>If this be ſo,
<note place="margin">Why An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Now its deſign is not to correct the defects of others, nor to give examples, becauſe Beaſts which are ſubject to this Paſſion can have no ſuch thought. Neither aims it at the ſeverity of him who hath been offended; as all the reſt of the Paſſions, ſhe reſpects her own particular preſervation onely, and being unable to hinder the offence from having been done, it will at leaſt hinder its continuance. In a word, it endeavors to take away the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47499:327"/>power of doing ill from him who hath done the injury, that he may do it no more.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, ſince Anger is a kind of Boldneſs, and that Boldneſs aſſaults ill to take away its power, Anger which aſſaults the cauſe of the ill muſt needs endeavor to take from him the power of doing ill; and becauſe that in thoſe cauſes which act with deſign, the Will is the beſt part of this power; it's certain, that taking the Will from them, the power is alſo taken away, or at leaſt it's rendred uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>Now there is nothing which can better take away the will of doing ill but by making him ſuffer ill who hath already done it, foraſmuch as the remembrance of the pain he ſuffers muſt needs hinder him from falling another time into the like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>So that the Soul hath no other end when ſhe will revenge herſelf in Anger, but to hinder him who hath done the injury, from continuing to do him the like: we find it certain by experience that whatſoever ſtops the courſe or the continuation of the offence, appeaſeth the Anger. So we are ſatisfied when he who hath done us an injury, hath been hurt, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, when he flies, when he makes it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47499:327"/>appear that he offended us not out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Forſmuch as we believe that the pain of his wounds will make him afraid to fall into the like fault; that his repentance hath changed his deſign of ill doing; that flying he hath loſt the power of it; and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended us unawares he did it unvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, he who is angry will himſelf execute his revenge, or if any do it for him, he will have it known that it was he that procured it, as if that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſerved to hinder the other from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing any more to offend him; inſtead that he who ſimply hates, cares not for that, and ſo his enemy ſuffers ill, he cares not whence he believes it comes. In fine, it's for this cauſe that thoſe calamities and great miſeries, extremety of ſickneſs and death it ſelf, which happens to thoſe who have injured us, take away from us that deſire of revenge, although they take not away the hatred and the averſion which we have againſt them; foraſmuch as in the condition in which they are they have not as it ſeems the power to offend us, and that Anger pretends not to do ill ſimply to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate him who ſuffers it, but to guard it ſelf from that violence which a man may afterwards receive.</p>
                        <pb n="274" facs="tcp:47499:328"/>
                        <p>This is the general end which Nature propoſeth to this Paſſion in reſpect of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which it inſpires in all creatures, and which conſequently in its ſource and original is an effect of this primary Juſtice, which moves every thing to its own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The policy and opinion of men hath added thereunto other particulars as Correction and Example, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Honor offended, and the preſervation of that excellency and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority wherewith they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>For although man conſidered in himſelf, may as well as the reſt of Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf of thoſe injuries which he hath received: Yet having been deſtined for a civil life and ſociety, having reſerved to it ſelf the right of revenge, as a matter belonging to the publick, he cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerciſe it without the help of Laws, unleſs the danger be very urgent, that he wants time to expect or ſeek their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; when therefore they revenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of particulars, it's firſt to provide for their ſecurity, becauſe it's the natural end of the Paſſion, and then to correct thoſe who have offended, and by their examples to keep others in their duties; they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves even to the opinions of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47499:328"/>men who think their honor receives ſome diminution when they ſuffer an injury with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſenting it, and that Vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can repair it; wherefore the Laws labor to give them this ſatisfaction, when they take upon them to revenge them; for although this opinion is a vicious fonn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and proceeds from that pride which is born with us; yet nevertheleſs having paſt into a cuſtom, and being in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upheld by Nature, the Law which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates it ſelf to out weakneſs tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates it, and will not take away from thoſe who have been offended, the conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have to believe that their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor hath had reparation by revenge.</p>
                        <p>In effect, Man who is naturally proud, and placeth one part of his glory neither to yeeld nor ſubmit himſelf, cannot ſuffer an injury without reſenting it, but he muſt at the ſame time confeſs his impotency and his ſubmiſſion; for if he get no ſatisfaction, it's out of weakneſs; if he will not ſeek it, it's out of reſpect: both ways he yields that preheminence which he pretends to with ſo much Paſſion: But when he revengeth himſelf, he makes it appear that he is not leſs powerful, nor leſs conſiderable then he who hath offended him, and thereby he thinks to change the opinion which
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47499:329"/>might have been conceived in prejudice of his excellency. Its therefore ſelf-love which caſts him in this error, and bereaves him of knowing himſelf deſtined for a civil life, wherein he may not exerciſe his revenge, but by the authority of the Laws, which after having made uſe of puniſhments for the publick good, doth alſo leave this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in thoſe who have been offended, that by that means they have preſerved their rights and advantages. However it be, this ſatisfaction is a particular end belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to human revenge, ſince Beaſts cannot pretend unto it, nor are they capable to ſeek reparation for an honor which they can neither acquire nor preſerve.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this, we can ſay no more on this ſubject,
<note place="margin">In all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there is a deſire of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> but onely to clear the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which we propoſed at the beginning of this Diſcourſe; to wit, when a man grows angry with himſelf, with his fortune, or with inſenſible things, ſince it's unlikely a man ſhould ſeek to revenge himſelf on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that Fortune is an imaginary thing, which is no more capable of ſuffering grief then all the reſt of inſenſible things; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we need not doubt but in all theſe encounters there is a deſire of vengeance, but its a blind and mad Appetite which the precipitation and impetuoſity of Anger
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47499:329"/>ſtirs up in the Soul; for this Paſſion raiſeth it ſelf ſo quick that it often prevents all the lights of Reaſon, and then we need not wonder if it know not thoſe things which move it, and if it often vary its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. We may indeed call it a kinde of Drunkenneſs, which makes trees appear like men, which repreſents all things double, and which fancies to it ſelf Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's to combat them withal; for he who is angry at his chance, doth he not faſhion out a fantaſm for an enemy? doth he not divide himſelf when angry with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is not his ſight troubled when he knows neither Parents nor Friends, &amp; takes inſenſible things as if they were capable of ſence? Theſe are therefore the effects of an offended Fancy, like thoſe which dreams or melancholy raiſe, and which make us believe that it's in theſe encounters that Anger is the commencement of folly, as ſays one of the moſt antient of all the Latin Poets.</p>
                        <p>Let's therefore conclude,
<note place="margin">Wherein Anger is different from Boldneſs.</note> That an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence received is the ground of this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that who hath committed it is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy it aſſaults, and that it riſeth up againſt it to procure its revenge. But for all this we have not yet found the principal differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which ought to be in this definition,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:47499:330"/>and which diſtinguiſheth it from all the reſt; for the Soul may riſe up againſt him who hath offended her, aſſault and combate him to revenge herſelf, without being moved by Anger; doth not this happen every day in War, wherein we aſſault our enemies, or we revenge the injuries we have received without accuſing this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bearing part? Wiſdom it ſelf, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity and Juſtice do they not often ſeek revenge of wrongs done them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſuſpected of having followed the counſels or motions of Anger. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt confeſs this is that rock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we may be afraid to loſe our ſelves; for after all this long diſcourſe we ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſay, that Anger and Boldneſs are but one and the ſame Paſſion, ſeeing they have ill for their object, they both aſſault it, and both would take away its power of doing ill. And although we may ſay that the Object of Boldneſs is more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal then that of Anger, ſince this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults onely the cauſe of ill, and the other aſſaults it what ill ſoever it be; that their End admits of the ſame difference, Anger having no other deſign but to take away the power of ill doing from that cauſe which hath already done it; and Boldneſs endeavoring to take it away without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47499:330"/>whether it be done or no; yet all this would onely ſerve to conclude, that Anger is a ſpecies and a difference onely of Boldneſs: And without doubt if we reſpect the end and the object onely of theſe two Paſſions, we muſt be forced to fall into this error; ſo that there remains the motion onely, whereby the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which is betwixt them is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                        <p>But what?
<note place="margin">What the motion of the Soul is in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> Both of them riſe up againſt ill, and it ſignifies nothing to ſay that this riſing up of Anger is more impetuous then that of Boldneſs; for beſides that it often happens that this is moved with as much or more violence, and more readily then the other, leſs and more cannot cauſe an eſſential difference in the Paſſions. Muſt it not then be Grief which ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Anger, which cauſeth ſome diverſity in theſe motions? for it's ſhe alone we can fancy is able to contribute any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And indeed this conjecture would be very likely, did not Grief very often joyn with Boldneſs, without moving Wrath; we may indeed reſent the ill, and repel it without being moved by this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and we ſee daily in ſingle combates that the grief for the wounds we have received, or the diſpleaſure we might have
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47499:331"/>to ſee ones enemy have the advantage, accompanies often Boldneſs without any eſmotion of Anger: We cannot ſay a Judge is moved with it when he compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionates him who hath ſuffered an injury, and will revenge him according to Law; and that a Father may not chaſtiſe his Children who have offended him without being ſenſible of the motions of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Finally, is it to be believed that a man always makes himſelf angry with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with a Beaſt that bites him, or a Serpent that ſtings him, when he drives them away, or aſſaults them? and yet in all theſe encounters Grief and Boldneſs are both met.</p>
                        <p>Yet muſt we not upon theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions renounce our propoſed conjecture;
<note place="margin">Anger is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Grief and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> for ſince Grief is ſo ſtrictly conjoyned with Anger, that it can never be ſeparated, and that it is but by chance it mixeth with Boldneſs; It's to be believed, that it unites it ſelf with this after another manner then it doth with the other, and that this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity cauſeth an eſſential difference in their motions. And certainly the Paſſions may mix together two ways; the one is by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their motions, ſo that the Soul at the ſame time ſuffers two Paſſions as Hope and Boldneſs, Boldneſs and Anger; the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47499:331"/>other is by making the motion of the one ſucceed the other, ſo that two Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons remain not together, but ſo ſwiftly follow one another that they ſeem to be but one, as Love and Deſire, Joy and Hope.</p>
                        <p>Grief therefore may joyn with Boldneſs both theſe ways; and without doubt, in the examples propoſed they do but follow one the other at ſeveral repriſals without uniting their motions. But when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found themſelves together they cauſe this Paſſion of Anger, which is nothing but the union and the confuſion of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for which cauſe Anger is never without them, becauſe they are the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts whereof it is compoſed. To confirm this truth, we need onely conſider, that the ſame offence raiſeth up in Anger a far more ſharp and fretful grief then in Boldneſs; for there is no other reaſon of this diverſity but that Grief and Boldneſs have contrary motions; and that the Soul being at the ſame time agitated by both, cannot but ſuffer a great violence, and that the diſpleaſure ſhe conceives for the injury received muſt needs be augmented by the pain ſhe is ſenſible of in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of theſe two Paſſions. Nature in effect which loves order and equality in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47499:332"/>all, flies as much as it may this contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of motions, and if ſhe finde herſelf engaged in it ſhe ſuffers it with pain and diſquiet; and if it be lawfull to ſay ſo, ſhe groans under ſo heavy a burthen which ſhe cannot long ſupport without being overwhelmed, which is the reaſon why Anger is not long laſting, and that it preſently changeth into other Paſſions, as into Hatred, Sadneſs, and into Deſpair.</p>
                        <p>But when Grief joyns wſth Boldneſs ſo that their motions are not confounded, and that they do but follow and ſucceed one another, the Soul is not conſtrained, and tortured, and ſuffers not that turbulent and painful agitation wherewith ſhe is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily moved in the encounter of two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite motions. For which cauſe Grief is not ſo pungent, nor doth it admit of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe which the pain and trouble of the Soul in Anger ſuffers.</p>
                        <p>Its true, that in this occaſion theſe two Paſſions follow one another ſo cloſe that they may eaſily be confounded, and ſo form Anger, as in fight it often happens, and after the ſame manner as Grief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in becomes more pungent; Boldneſs alſo becomes more impetuous by reaſon of the endeavor the Soul makes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint which thoſe two contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47499:332"/>cauſe in it, as we ſhall ſay hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>What may be objected againſt this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, may be,
<note place="margin">Whether any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be found without any cauſe of offence</note> that to form Anger there muſt be a cauſe which offends with intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that it may happen that Grief and Boldneſs might confound themſelves, were it not for that cauſe, and therefore altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without their moving of Anger. But we may boldly anſwer, that it's impoſſible it ſhould ſo happen, and that if Grief and Boldneſs unite, when no cauſe hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an injury, ſtill the Soul fancies one, as when a man is angry with himſelf, with fortune, and with inſenſible things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soul which is inſtructed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in all what is neceſſary for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Paſſions, knows what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is proper for every one of them, what object ought to move them, and what end ſhe ought to propoſe herſelf in them; and not one of theſe things preſents it ſelf ſo ſoon to our knowledge, but it preſently adds two others, ſo that in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as when ſhe reſents an injury, ſhe at the ſame time forms the deſign of revenging herſelf, and afterwards agitates herſelf by that motion which is proper for Anger; ſo when ſhe findes herſelf agitated with this motion, the cauſe which ought to move
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47499:333"/>this Paſſion not occurring therein, knowing it is that ſhe is accuſtomed to make uſe of in Anger, ſhe forms to herſelf the cauſe and object of Anger, and ſo perfects that Paſſion which this motion had onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced: And this is the more eaſie to be believed, for that the motion of the ſpirits which makes no part of the Paſſion as that of the Appetite doth, cauſeth the ſame effect. For if it happen that the ſpirits are agitated with a motion proper to a Paſſion, the Soul which ſees what paſſeth in her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and knows after what manner ſhe is accuſtomed to ſtir them up, preſently fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that object which ought to excite this motion; and at laſt agitates it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to that motive which this object inſpires it withall, and ſo that eſmotion which it meets within the ſpirits. It's thus that Muſick produceth Paſſion; it's thus that Love out of inclination is formed, as we have ſhewed in the Treatiſe we have made thereof. It's then true that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is nothing elſe but Grief and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs united and confounded together, and that the turbulent and unequal agitation which the Soul is conſtrained to ſuffer in the encounter, and in the ſhock of theſe two oppoſite Paſſions, makes that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of motion which is proper unto it,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:47499:333"/>and which diſtinguiſheth it from all the reſt. In effect, we cannot conceive that the Appetite in Grief retires it ſelf, and that at the ſame time Boldneſs raiſeth it up, but we muſt fancy we ſee a Sea agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with contrary winds and waves, for the ſame combate which is made amongſt the waves, the ſame boylings which it raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, the ſame efforts with which it beats upon the ſhoar. Finally, the ſame trouble and confuſion which this great Main ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers during the tempeſt, are in the Soul when ſhe is ſtirred up by theſe two violent Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>So that it is not without reaſon that we ſay the Sea grows angry, and that Anger is a tempeſt, ſince there is the ſame agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in either of them, and that both of them ſpring from the contrariety of motions which ſhake theſe two great depths.</p>
                        <p>But we may ſay That if Anger be a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Grief and of Boldneſs, it cannot be in the rank of ſimple Paſſions, as we have hitherto conceived, and as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this work we our ſelves reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Certainly, there needs no conteſt hereupon, and it were to fight againſt the truth to defend the common opinion; for if there is a Paſſion which is mixt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:47499:334"/>it's chiefly this, where Grief and Boldneſs, Deſire and Hope are all met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. That if we propoſed it as a ſimple Paſſion, beſides that we did not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe reaſons which ought to oblige us to ſhun the errors of the School, we may freely confeſs that upon the way we often diſcovered thoſe things which at firſt we never thought to have met withal, and that conſidering more nearly the nature of this Paſſion, Reaſon and Truth have made it appear unto us to be altogether compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that is to ſay, of Grief and Boldneſs, as of its eſſential parts, and of Deſire and Hope as of inſeparable accidents or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conditions which accompany it. For it's certain, that he that is angry ought to deſire and hope for revenge. Yet the Mind may ſeparate theſe two Paſſions from Anger without deſtroying its Nature, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as without conſidering them it may conceive the Soul may be touched with Grief for the injury received, and that ſhe aſſaults the cauſe which cauſed it, wherein all the Eſſence of Anger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
                        <p>So that now we may define it to be <hi>A turbulent Agitation which Grief and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs move in the Appetite,
<note place="margin">Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> whereby the Soul retires in herſelf, to eſtrange herſelf from the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:47499:334"/>injury received, and at the ſame time raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth herſelf up againſt the cauſe which cauſed it to be done, for to revenge herſelf of it.</hi> Whence we may judge, that as this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is mixed, its cauſes and effects are alſo of the ſame nature; for it hath indeed two objects, to wit the Injury and him who did it: It hath two ends, the one to eſtrange it ſelf from ill, and the other to revenge it ſelf. Laſtly, it's compoſed of two motions, which being united cauſe this turbulent agitation, wherein we have ſaid the principal difference of this Paſſion conſiſts.</p>
                        <p>Yet we are to obſerve, that as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Boldneſs vapors more in Anger then in Grief, and yet that there are ſome Angers in which Grief appears ſtronger then Boldneſs; Its certain, that in theſe encounters the motions of theſe two Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are proportionably ſtronger or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that it often happens that its riſing up is greater then its contraction; and that ſometimes alſo its contraction is more then its lifting up; but if they are equal, Boldneſs always appears more then Grief, becauſe in that the Soul produceth and caſts it ſelf forth, and in Grief ſhe hides and inwardly retires herſelf, as we ſhall make it more particularly appear in the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47499:335"/>Chapter, wherein we ſhall examine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>We muſt conclude this long Diſcourſe with a reſolution of an important difficulty which may here be made:
<note place="margin">Who thoſe are which are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Anger.</note> For perhaps ſome will ſay, that if Boldneſs makes a part of Anger, it will follow that thoſe who are naturally bold, will alſo be moſt inclined to this Paſſion. On the contrary, thoſe who are timorous, ſhould never be ſenſible of it. Although experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that thoſe who are truly Bold, are ſeldom provoked to Anger, and that Children, Women and ſick perſons which are weak and timorous, are eaſily moved thereunto. But this objection is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, if we remember that Boldneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone never produceth this Paſſion, but that Grief muſt alſo meet with it, that theſe mix and confound themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In a word, that a man muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of injuries, and have a quick and agile Boldneſs to be ſuſceptible of Anger. Now thoſe who have an heroick Boldneſs, are not ſenſible of injuries unleſs they are very couſiderable, becauſe they deſpiſe moſt of thoſe things which aſſault them, and that that Melancholy which is in their temperature retains the fury of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, giving them time to examine the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:47499:335"/>and to conſider whether they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be chaſtiſed. On the contrary, thoſe who are weak of body or of mind, and who have a very agile heat, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Women, and thoſe who have any remarkable defect, finding themſelves more expoſed to injuries, are eaſily born away with a deſire of vengeance, becauſe their weakneſs makes them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend every thing, and the ſubtile heat which they have is ſo quickly inflamed, that they have not time enough to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether they are truly injured, and whether they ought to revenge themſelves, or whether indeed they have the power; and that is the reaſon why the Cholerick are the moſt angry of all, becauſe they have an ardent and active heat, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all their actions precipitate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves them of time and means to judge rightly of things; For it's certain that there is no quality ſo much an enemy to Reaſon as Heat, and a violent agitation; all the functions of Sence, and principally thoſe of Judgment, being not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed but when the Soul enjoys a great Tranquillity, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays. Whence it alſo happens that Nature hath placed the brain ſo far from the principle of heat, that its quiet might not be diſturbed by the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47499:336"/>neighborhood of that active and turbulent quality, as we ſhall more amply hereafter declare.</p>

                        <p>AS Rivers which run into the Sea are ſenſible of thoſe ſtorms wherewith it is agitated;
<note place="margin">The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Anger have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> thoſe ſpirits which like Rivers take their ſource from the Soul, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves there alſo, muſt needs ſuffer part of that great tempeſt which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger raiſeth therein: And they muſt be ſhaken with the ſame violence and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhe reſents in herſelf. If it be therefore true, that ſhe is then moved with two contrary motions, and that at the ſame time when Grief makes her retire, Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs raiſeth her up and drives her forth; it's neceſſary that the ſpirits to whom ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates all her commotions muſt be agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated after the ſame manner; and that as ſhe doth, they muſt reſtrain and retreat themſelves at the ſame inſtant, when ſhe raiſeth and darts herſelf forth againſt ill.</p>
                        <pb n="291" facs="tcp:47499:336"/>
                        <p>And certainly did not Reaſon force the mind to confeſs this Truth, the effects which Anger produces would ſufficiently prove it. For beſides that a man often grows pale when he is carried away with this Paſſion, that his voice is vehement and ſharp, and that commonly we ſee in his Face ſadneſs mix and confound it ſelf with fury, which can proceed from nothing but this contrariety of motions; it's impoſſible to doubt it, if we conſider the different pulſe which is proper for Anger, and the conſiſtence which the Heart and the Lungs have when it's kindled in thoſe parts; for it hath this in particular, That it makes the pulſe higher, and more elevated, then large and extended; And that it retires the Heart and Lungs in themſelves, although it then ſwells them and raiſeth them up; now this can be but from theſe two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite motions we have ſpoken of, as we ſhall more fully declare when we enquire into the cauſes of thoſe effects.</p>
                        <p>But although this be moſt certain, yet we muſt confeſs that it's harder to conceive how ſuch bodies as the ſpirits are, can at the ſame time ſuffer motions which ſeem incompatible; for although there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples in Nature which make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that a body may be moved in ſuch a
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47499:337"/>manner; that Fiſh which ſwims againſt the courſe of the water, are inſenſibly carried away with the force of the ſtream; that a man may walk in a ſhip contrary to the courſe he ſhapes, and that the heavens themſelves, are, as they ſay, carried towards the Weſt by the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> whilſt by their natural inclination they tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt. Yet this clears not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, but leaves ſtill a great difference betwixt theſe motions, and thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſpirits are agitated in this Paſſion; for that there is but one motion in the former proper to the body moved; the other is as a ſtranger, and as the School ſays, happens by accident; but here theſe two motions which the ſpirits ſuffer are proper unto them, it's the ſame mover which produceth them, it's the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which receives them; and it ſeems a contradiction, that at the ſame time a thing ſhould advance it ſelf and go backwards, that it ſhould tend to two oppoſite places. In a word, that it ſhould be and not be, in the place where it is.</p>
                        <p>We muſt therefore fay, that there are two ways whereby the ſpirits may receive theſe contrary motions;
<note place="margin">How the ſpirits ſuffer contrary motions.</note> The firſt ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to have divers parts, ſome of which are agitated after one manner, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47499:337"/>others after another; juſt as it happens in the Streights, where contrary Currents and Seas meet; for as there are ſome waves which enter into one another, ſome which juſtle and cauſe the beatings they give one another to boil exceedingly; the ſame thing certainly is here done, where one part of the Spirits which follows the motion of Grief, and another which is carried away with that of Boldneſs, and which meeting on the way cauſeth this turbulent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal agitation which is obſervable in this Paſſion; the ſame way is like that which is performed in Boldneſs, wherein the ſpirits ſtiffen themſelves in themſelves, and yet forbear not to dart themſelves forth. For ſeeing the parts of a body may amongſt themſelves ſuffer a motion which may be different from that wherewith the whole body is agitated, as it happens to the Arm, when at the ſame time we ſtiffen and ſtretch it forth. So it may alſo be that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may retire in themſelves, and at the ſame time be violently driven into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts. And truly as Grief makes its impreſſion before Boldneſs, becauſe we muſt reſent an injury before we will our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; it's certain, that at that inſtant the ſpirits reſtrain themſelves; ſo that Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs coming after, and not driving Grief
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47499:338"/>away, it muſt raiſe the Spirits reſtrained as they are, and without making them loſe the diſpoſition it finds them in, drive them to thoſe places where they are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                        <p>Now although in little Angers it may happen that the Spirits will be moved onely after the latter manner, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are by both ſorts at once, and it muſt neceſſarily be. The better to conceive this great ſtorm which they raiſe in the veins, we muſt fancy to our ſelves that they do not onely reſtrain themſelves, as we have ſaid; but that there are ſome which run and flie to the heart, and others which iſſue out and impetuouſly caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forth, and that in this encounter which is thereby made, they embroyl and confound themſelves, they juſtle and raiſe themſelves up, and ſo they make a current full of boilings and of foam; it's true, that according as Grief or Boldneſs predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in this Paſſion, the ebbing and flowing of the ſpirits is ſtronger or weaker; for when Grief is greater, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly what we ſay is to be vexed, there are more ſpirits which retire to the heart then there are which are darted forth. On the contrary, when Boldneſs is greater, as when Anger is violent, and turns even into
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47499:338"/>Fury, there are more ſpirits which dart themſelves forth then retire; and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſhock which they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot be ſo great, and ſeems to be unable to cauſe this agitation, which is when they are of equal force; yet this hinders not that trouble and tempeſt to be therein formed with the ſame violence which the exceſs of this Paſſion requires; foraſmuch as if the ſhock is not then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the encounter of theſe oppoſite motions; yet it's made by the frequent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the ſpirits, which like impetuous floods precipitate themſelves on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and making haſte to follow the firſt, finding them in their way daſh againſt them, and drive them as if they indeed op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their courſe.</p>
                        <p>For it's the property of Boldneſs and Anger to move the Soul and the Spirits by ſallies and by ſwinges;
<note place="margin">The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſallies.</note> foraſmuch as the danger they are threatned withal continually ſollicites them to make new endeavors to ſurmount them, which commonly happens not to thoſe Paſſions which tend to good, where the Soul having nothing to fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandons herſelf to every object which pleaſeth, and as if ſhe would caſt herſelf whole, and all at once before it; ſhe drives the Spirits thereunto like a flood, without
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47499:339"/>minding to recreate them, whence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards follow Languors, Swoonings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidents which we have treated of in our Diſcourſe of Joy.</p>
                        <p>But although theſe ſallies are common to Boldneſs and Anger; it's certain, that they are more frequent and more readily doubled in this then in the other; becauſe Grief which always accompanies it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes, and at every moment urgeth the Soul; and that weakneſs often meets with it, which renders it the more diligent and careful; inſtead that in Boldneſs, ſeeing onely the ill comes without reſenting it, and confiding in her own ſtrength, ſhe believes that this crowding of them together is no ways neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Let's therefore conclude, that Grief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the Spirits, and makes them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to the Heart; that Boldneſs ſtiffens and drives them forth, that the forcings of the Soul cauſe them to make theſe ſallies, which at every moment precipitates them one on another, and that from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of ſo many different motions this turbulent ebullition and agitation proceeds wherewith the Spirits are agitated in this Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>To ſeek now what the end of all theſe motions is, and what the Souls motives is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47499:339"/>when ſhe excites them, were a uſeleſs thing, at leaſt in reſpect of the ſtiffening and darting forth of the Spirits, which have been curiouſly examined in the precedent Chapters: And as for thoſe which Grief cauſeth, we ſhall then propoſe them, when we treat of that Paſſion; for as concerning the ſhock, the ebullition, and the trouble which here happens, they are effects which are done out of neceſſity, without the Souls intention of producing them, being altogether uſeleſs for her deſign.</p>
                        <p>Yet not to leave the Reader in doubt concerning thoſe two kindes of motions which in Grief we aſſigned the ſpirits, it ſhall ſuffice to ſay by way of advance, that the ſoul is not at that time content to cauſe the Spirits to retire to the heart, but that ſhe alſo cauſeth them to ſhut themſelves up in themſelves, and in the deſign which ſhe hath to eſtrange herſelf from the ill which urgeth her, ſhe conceives ſlight is not able to ſave her from the danger, unleſs ſhe ſhut herſelf up in herſelf, if ſhe ſtop not the Enemies paſſage, and if as much as ſhe poſſibly can ſhe hide not herſelf from him.</p>
                        <p>After this it will be nothing difficult to declare how Hope and Deſire which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with Anger, may finde in the eſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47499:340"/>ſhe cauſeth that which is proper for them, and cauſeth their ſubſiſtence; for ſince the ſpirits dart themſelves forth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſtiffen themſelves in hope; Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which cauſeth both of theſe motions, muſt needs favor the birth and preſervation of theſe two Paſſions; even ſo it is with Hate and Averſion, which commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Anger, foraſmuch as their agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being conformable to that Grief raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up as in its place we ſhall make known, it's nothing ſtrange that they are found with it, that they dwell together and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one the other.</p>
                        <p>What is moſt difficult herein,
<note place="margin">How the motion of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Anger can ſuffer that of Joy.</note> is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate how all theſe motions may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves with that of Joy; for it's certain, that in the hight of danger, the hope of revenge alone ſatisfies the Mind, and even we have an extream pleaſure to imagine we are revenged, and that Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance executed is ſweeter then hony, as the Poet ſays. Now if Joy dilates and ſweetly diſperſeth the Spirits, how is it poſſible it can ſubſiſt with Anger, which reſtrains and drives them forth with impetuoſity? We may hereupon ſay, that Joy may form it ſelf in the ſuperior part of the Soul, whilſt Anger agitater the inferior, and that when the Spirits which ſerve theſe two Powers
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:47499:340"/>are moved with contrary motions without incompatibility, becauſe it's performed in ſeveral places. But if Joy deſcends into the inferior part, we muſt neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that in the ſame inſtant ſhe drives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Anger, that the ſtorm which this raiſed diſſipates it ſelf at the arrival of a Paſſion which always brings with it a calm and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity. In effect, when a man flatters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the pleaſure which he ſhall reap in his revenge, he reſents not the ſame agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and thoſe tranſports which poſſeſt him before, his looks are more ſweet, his countenance is calm, and all his actions are more modeſt. I confeſs that this may be very ſuddenly changed, but yet it's ſtill true that at that inſtant he reſents it not, and that Pleaſure and Anger are two Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may ſucceed one another, but yet are incompatible as well by reaſon of the contrary motions which they produce, as of the oppoſite motives which they have. This clearly appears when we have effectually revenged our ſelves, for then Anger quite ceaſeth, and the Joy of the Victory we have obtained remains alone, and thoſe Paſſions which uſually follow it, as Vanity, Inſolency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">What kind of heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Anger.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We ſhould now ſpeak of that Heat which accompanies theſe motions, and the ardor
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:47499:341"/>which this Paſſion kindles in all the parts. But this hath been amply done in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Boldneſs, wherein we did ſhew that the Soul and the Heart have power to augment the natural heat when it's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that ſhe hath no occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its aſſiſtance is more uſeful then in thoſe Paſſions which are to aſſault ill. For as this quality is the moſt agile of all, and moſt fit to deſtroy what is hurtful, it's alſo the moſt powerful inſtrument which the Soul hath to employ in its combates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt deſign ſhe hath is to bereave the enemy of his power of doing ill. For which reaſon in theſe encounters ſhe raiſeth it up, ſhe augments it, and entertains it in the Heart, which is its natural ſource, and from thence by a particular priviledge which theſe two Paſſions have, ſhe ſends it to thoſe organs which ſhe intends to employ. If in effect there are others in which ſhe is diſperſed to the outward parts, it is not that it is ſent thither becauſe it is uſeleſs; it's becauſe it follows thoſe Spirits which are ſent thither; but herein both of them are led by the Soul, being neceſſary for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which ſhe propoſeth herſelf; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to conveigh ſtrength to the parts, and heat to deſtroy the ill which preſents it ſelf.</p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:47499:341"/>
                        <p>Now ill is more urgent in Anger then in Boldneſs, for thoſe Reaſons which we have deduced, we need not doubt but the heat renders it ſelf therein alſo more violent, as well out of the greatneſs of the endeavour it makes to produce it, as for that of the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſpirits, and the riſing up of thoſe pungent humors which it incites. In effect it is certain that it ſeparates Choler, and all what is moſt malignant in the veins, and that it uſeth them as offenſive arms, the more eaſily to deſtroy the enemy. Whence it happens that the bitings of all kinde of creatures are in ſome ſort venemous when they are angry, and the more irritated they are, the more dangerous, and hard to be cured; which ought to make us judge that their teeth are then infected with ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humor which Nature brings into thoſe parts, after having ſeparated it from the reſt, to render it the more miſchevous and fitter to effect what ſhe intends: It's alſo true, that the ſeparation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors renders them more active, giving them liberty, and reſtoring them that ſtrength which mixture had weakened. But that we may the better clear the Truth of ſo new a propoſition, we muſt examine whether the Soul hath the power thus to ſeparate the humors; and if after having
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:47499:342"/>ſeparated them ſhe can remix them again, and reinſtate them as they were before.</p>
                        <p>As for the firſt, a man muſt be very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what is done in Nature, and of what is performed in our ſelves, to doubt of ſo certain and ſo evident a thing. The choice which the Soul makes of what is fit for every part, ſo many kindes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors as ſhe at every moment drives out of the moſt healthful bodies, ſo many evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as ſhe cauſeth in ſickneſs, make it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appear that ſhe hath the power to ſeparate what is profitable from what is not ſo, and that if ſhe have a deſign to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy venom or choler to execute her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſhe may draw them from the maſs and places where they are, and afterwards ſend them to thoſe places where ſhe intends to uſe them.</p>
                        <p>The other point is more difficult to be reſolved;
<note place="margin">Whether Nature can reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the Humors which ſhe hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.</note> for it ſeems that the order which Nature obſerves is to drive out what it hath ſeparated, and never to remingle ill humors with good, when ſhe hath once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them from one another; ſo that if in Anger ſhe ſeparate venom and choler to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them againſt ill, ſhe muſt drive them out without remixing them any more with the reſt. And yet we cannot doubt but that when Anger is over, the Humors retake
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:47499:342"/>their former places, and but that the Body returns to his priſtine conſtitution. We muſt therefore ſay that there are uſeful and uſeleſs Humore, that both of them may be within and without the Veins, and that that order which Nature obſerves is different according as ſhe is free or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. When ſhe acts freely, after having ſeparated the Humors, and driven them out of the veins, ſhe recalls them thither no more, and how good ſoever they be, ſhe muſt needs drive them out of the Body: So the Seroſity which is in the Bladder, Choler which is in the bag of the Gall, Blood it ſelf being out of its veſſels, never returns into that Maſs from whence they were drawn, but ſhe quite expels them; but whilſt theſe Humors remain in the veins, ſhe may ſeparate them from the reſt, and after remingle them together, as ſhe commonly doth in Paſſions, in Feavors, and in thoſe Criſis's which are imperfect; for when Choler is driven by Anger into the ſurface of the Body, after the ſtorm is over, it reſumes the place again which it had in the maſs of the blood, and remix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf with it as it was before. It's true that this is not done in a moment, and that time is requiſite to reſettle it; for which reaſon a man that is let blood, at
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:47499:343"/>his going out of the violence of this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his blood commonly appears altogether changed, and a diverſity of colours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, which would make a man believe it were corrupted, were one not aſſured that after the return of a calm no ſuch thing is to be ſeen, and that it proceeded onely from this diſunion of the Humors, which uniting themſelves again return to the blood its former colour.</p>
                        <p>This reunion is alſo to be found in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors which are commonly cauſed by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration which is made in the veins of thoſe ill Humors which are there gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; for although it be Nature which ſeparates them that ſhe may drive them out, it often happens that they are ſo malignant that ſhe dares not undertake it, and leaving them thus in their veſſels, ſhe endeavors to repair the error which ſhe had committed by raiſing up heat to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, remixing them with the reſt to temper and ſweeten them; and laſtly labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their decoction, the firſt effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to reaſſemble divided things; but if we obſerve what is done in theſe criſis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s, we need no longer doubt of this Truth; for it ſometimes happens that Nature being diſpoſed to terminate a ſickneſs by ſweat, after even having already begun, ſhe all at
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47499:343"/>once ſtops and retains that humor which was ready to iſſue out. Now it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould be left in the veins, but it muſt embroyl it ſelf with the reſt of the blood, ſince ſhe often retains it the better to concoct it; that ſhe reaſſumes her deſign of driving it out many days after, and that there is no likelihood that in ſo long a time ſo fluid and penetrating a Humor ſhould preſerve it ſelf in its paucity, without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf with the reſt. To conclude, if the ſpirits iſſue out of their veſſels, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves not onely in the parts but in the Humors themſelves which are corrupted, and that after having perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their function they retire to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and reunite themſelves with thoſe ſpirits which they had left, as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Diſcourſe of Digeſtion, why ſhould not thoſe parts of the blood which go not out of the veins do the ſame thing? For when we ſay Choler riſeth in Anger, we mean nothing elſe but the moſt ſubtile and the hotteſt part of the blood, and not that Choler which is an excrement and without the veins; it being true that the Soul never cauſeth this to remount when ſhe acts freely, and follows her ordinary courſe, if it happen that ſhe is preſt and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47499:344"/>conſtrained by the violence of a Paſſion, or of ſome diſeaſe, it's true then there are no Humors how malignant ſoever they be, and in what place ſoever they may be, but ſhe can raiſe them up, and force them to re-enter the veins, and the moſt conſiderable parts. It's thus that vehement Anger is ſometimes followed with the Jaundiſe, with an Apoplexy, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion fits, trembling of the Nerves, and other ſuch like Diſeaſes, which are cauſed by that violent tranſport of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors we have ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>It's thus that in malignant Feavers we ſee ſo many ſad and unlook'd for acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happen, which aſtoniſh the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and overthrow the Patient: But this Diſcourſe concerns Phyſick; let us pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue our deſign, and ſeek the cauſes of thoſe Characters which are proper to this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                        <p>ALthough Anger be compoſed of Grief and Boldneſs, and for the ſame cauſe its probable it ſhould have no other Characters, but thoſe which thoſe two Paſſions ſeparately produce; yet as in all other things mixture affords new vertues, or ſo confounds thoſe which are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, that it makes them appear altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different from what they were; it alſo happens that Anger beſides thoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which are common to her with Boldneſs and Grief, it hath others parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars added unto it, which are not at all to be found in the other, if at leaſt they encounter it is with very great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                        <p>Indeed if we do but conſider theſe which it forms in the Soul, it hath even as Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Hope, Confidence and Freeneſs; it hath juſt as Grief, Peeviſhneſs, Impatience and Heavineſs: But Pride, Fury and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair are far different herein from thoſe which accompany thoſe two Paſſions; for if Boldneſs is proud, it hath ſtrength to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:47499:345"/>maintain its Pride, if it be carried away with Fury, it's after great ſtrivings, and it never happens at its beginning: If final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grief eaſily fall into Deſpair, it's a timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, baſe, heedleſs deſpair; but Anger hath a Boldneſs which is commonly vain, and without any ground, a precipitate fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindled at the inſtant of its birth; and when it is in deſpair of revenge, it's a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, violent and enraged Deſpair; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, it in particular <hi>makes great threatnings, ſpeaks much, diſcovers its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; it's credulous, impudent and opinionate; it's baſe, cruel, and inſolent:</hi> But this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity appears alſo in the corporal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as we ſhall make it known af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have examined the cauſes of theſe.</p>
                        <p>Let's therefore begin with <hi>Hope,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Why Hope devance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Anger</note> which ever gives a beginning to Anger; for it's certain that this Paſſion is never kindled in the heart, what injury ſoever a man hath received, or what deſire ſoever to retort it, but firſt he hopes to have his revenge: So that we are ſeldom angry with thoſe that are extreamly above us; Demons or dead bodies although they may offend us, will never provoke us; and it hath ſeldom been ſeen that a man of a low condition hath been carried away with
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:47499:345"/>wrath againſt his King or againſt his Lord, foraſmuch as ſuch perſons are ſo high that they ſeem to be out of reach, and that it is, as it were, impoſſible to do them any harm, and that ſo having no hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revenged, they find it's to no end to be angry with them.</p>
                        <p>But ſince this Hope cannot be founded but on thoſe forces which we believe we have,
<note place="margin">How weak perſons hope to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> and that Natures which are moſt weak, ſuch as are Women, and Children, and ſick perſons, are extreamly ſuſceptible of Anger; how is it poſſible they ſhould hope to be revenged, having not the power, and carrying always about them a ſecret ſence of their own weakneſs, as hereafter we ſhall make it appear?</p>
                        <p>Certainly it's eaſie to judge by thoſe vain endeavors which they make in theſe encounters, that it's from the error of their thoughts, and that the Soul ſuffers it ſelf often to be deceived in the Judgment ſhe makes of her forces. Now this error commonly proceeds from the motion of heat which awakens and augments it ſelf in this Paſſion; for as we have ſaid in the Diſcourſe of Boldneſs, this quality taking part with the corporal forces, being ſeated in the Heart, and being, if we may ſo ſpeak, neareſt the Iraſcible Appetite, it
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47499:346"/>cannot be irritated nor increaſed without the Souls being abuſed with a vain opinion which it perſwades that ſhe is ſtrong enough to undertake great matters.</p>
                        <p>It's as with a Prince who hearkens onely to generous counſels, to whom his power and greatneſs are onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and who ſees no man that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him not to take up arms. For how weak ſoever he is, inceſſantly finding himſelf ſollicited by thoſe violent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, having his ears always filled with their flatteries, he at laſt ſuffers himſelf to be perſwaded, and without conſidering his impotency engageth himſelf in temerous undertakings; the Soul often doth the like in the weakeſt bodies, when natural heat kindles it ſelf it the Heart, ſeeing nothing about it, if we may ſo ſpeak, but this float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unquiet quality, being every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment provoked by its ardor and by its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity, and ſuffering it ſelf to be ſurpriſed by the oſtentation ſhe makes of her power and vertue, ſhe at laſt imagines her forces are greater then indeed they are, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remembring her weakneſs ſhe reſolves to combate the ill, and flatters herſelf with the hope of obtaining the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                        <p>But it may be enquired, what it is which
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47499:346"/>then thus irritates and augments this heat,
<note place="margin">What it is that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritates heat in weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> foraſmuch as if it be the Soul, as we have ſaid, which employs it to deſtroy the ill, ſhe muſt needs hope to overcome it, before ſhe will offer to make uſe of it, ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign always goes before thoſe means which are proper to execute it, and that in effect the Paſſions are immanent actions, which form themſelves in the Soul before the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſents them; for there is no queſtion but Hope accompanies ſtrong and robu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtious conſtitutions; where it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that heat ſhould be irritated to raiſe up this Paſſion, it's enough for them that they know their forces, and are aſſured of them; but here where weakneſs is whereof the Soul hath the knowledge, and which conſequently ought to make her miſtruſt herſelf, there muſt needs be ſomething to animate her courage. In a word, it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Heat ſhould be augmented before Hope can be therein formed: And yet we ſee nothing which can raiſe it, ſince we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there is nothing in the Soul but Grief which proceeds from the injury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that this Paſſion far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing heat, is that which diminiſheth and at laſt extinguiſheth it.</p>
                        <p>To reſolve this difficulty, we muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a ſecret which hath not hitherto been
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47499:347"/>diſcovered in the Paſſions,
<note place="margin">That there are Paſſions in the lowermost part of the Soul.</note> and ſay, that in all Animals there are two Appetites, the one which is ſenſitive, and the other which is natural; that both purſue what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and flie what is ill; And that both of them again raiſe themſelves up againſt what is contrary unto them to overcome it.</p>
                        <p>For it's certain that in ſickneſs Nature irritates herſelf againſt ill, and ſtirs up her forces to drive it away, and that this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is anſwerable to Anger and to Boldneſs, which form themſelves in the ſenſitive Soul.</p>
                        <p>So that all motion of the Appetite making a Paſſion, this natural Appetite which hath its particular motions, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have its particular Paſſions. It's true, they are not ſo perfect, nor in ſo great a number as the others, being led by a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge leſs exact, and which diſcerns not the objects ſo well as the imagination, for which cauſe there are few, unleſs it be Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Grief, Boldneſs and Fear, which are obſerved to be in this lower part of the Soul; they are likewiſe ſo imperfect that we may ſee they are but groſs unfiniſhed images, or the roughcaſts of the reſt; for the pain which Nature ſuffers, and I know not what kind of peeviſhneſs which follows
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47499:347"/>the indiſpoſitions of the Body, are to ſpeak truly, but feeble beginnings of true Grief; like as thoſe ſecret glimmerings, and thoſe pleaſant reſentments which accompany na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural actions, are but the ſhadows of Joy and of Pleaſure; And although Nature provokes and inſenſibly raiſeth herſelf up againſt ill, and that we alſo often ſee that ſhe is aſtoniſhed and loſeth Courage in the conflict, they are motions which indeed have relation to the Boldneſs and fear of this ſenſitive part, but are very far from their perfection, as it is very eaſie to judge.</p>
                        <p>All what can be ſaid hereupon is, that theſe motions deſerve not the name of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, being not conducted by any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is abſolutely neceſſary to form the Paſſions; but beſides that there is a hidden knowledge in all the things of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it's moſt certain that it's more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and more apparent in ſome then in others; and that this natural Appetite is more enlightned in Animals then in Plants; for beſides this obſcure and ſecret know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which it hath for vegetative acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it's alſo conducted by the vital fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which acts with ſo much light and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, that divers did believe it was the ſpringe of the ſenſitive Soul; Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:47499:348"/>Philoſophy hath reſtrained the name of Paſſions to ſuch motions as are made by the direction of ſence, yet we may perceive that its a far fetched circumſtance which comes not near the eſſence of the thing, and that the motion of the Soul for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears not to be a true motion, although it follows not the orders of the ſenſitive Soul, ſo that if it hath not all the conditions of Paſſion exactly ſo taken, yet at leaſt it hath, if we may ſo ſpeak, the body and ſubſtance thereof: In a word, it's ſo like it that as the name of Paſſions hath been given to the eſmotions of the Will by reaſon of the reſemblance which they nave with thoſe of the ſenſitive Appetite, for want of terms more fit, we may call the motions of the natural Appetite Paſſions, although they are not ſo perfect, and that even perhaps they are of another order, and of another gender.</p>
                        <p>However it be theſe two Appetites which may ſometimes, move ſeparately, as we may experiment it in our ſelves, when Nature combates ſickneſs, and we are nothing ſenſible of any of the ſenſitive Paſſions, they commonly relieve one the other, and communicate their motions when they are powerfully agitated; whence it happens that violent Paſſions cauſe ſuch
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:47499:348"/>great diſorders in the body, that the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs and ſecrer contentment which we have now ſpoken of ends at laſt in ſadneſs or in real joyes; and that Grief cannot be very ſtrong in the ſenſitive part, but that it muſt be ſenſible to the natural Faculties, and particularly to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
                        <p>Now Nature hath this property, when the ill is come to her knowledge, to raiſe up herſelf againſt it, and endeavor to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome it, ſtiring up the natural heat, and with the ſpirits conveighing it into thoſe parts where ſhe thinks it is. Thus inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations happen to wounds; thus pain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth when the impoſtumes ripen, and that a Feavor breeds in a corrupt body; for all theſe accidents are effects of this Heat which Nature ſtirs up, and renders ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to combate the ills ſhe reſents.</p>
                        <p>This being true, we need not doubt that when weak and timorous perſons ſuffer a very ſenſible injury, the grief it cauſeth in the ſenſitive Appetite can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the natural Appetite: And then this power following its inclination muſt needs riſe up againſt the ill, and according to its cuſtom ſtir up natural heat to overcome it; for its undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence the redneſs proceeds which
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:47499:349"/>appears in the countenance upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of a great grief, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanies thoſe firſt tears which grief makes us ſhed, as in its place ſhall be more fitly expreſt.</p>
                        <p>If it be therefore true, that Heat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens and augments it ſelf in Grief, ſhe may form Hope for the Reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related; ſo that we can no ways doubt but that Anger is ever devanced by this Paſſion, even in the weakeſt and moſt timorous Natures.</p>
                        <p>Yet we muſt here remember what we ſaid before; That that diſpoſition which was neceſſary to produce this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is, that we are very ſenſible of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and that heat is very agile, as without doubt it is in the Temperature of Women and Children who are compoſed of an agile and ſubtile humidity, wherein heat and the ſpirits are eaſily agitated without encountring any obſtacle; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in that weakneſs wherein the Soul perceives her ſelf, ſhe hath no time to conſider it, ſo that ſhe muſt needs be ſurpriſed, and as it were drawn away by the precipitate motion of heat; She would otherwiſe never engage herſelf in fight, nor ever believe ſhe could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her Enemy.</p>
                        <pb n="317" facs="tcp:47499:349"/>
                        <p>Thence it is that Natures in whom Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and Phlegm are thick and groſs, are hardly made angry what ill ſoever you do them, becauſe the Spirits move themſelves with pain under the weight of ſuch heavy Humors, and that the Soul hath time enough to conſider its weakneſs before they can make their way or free themſelves: So that what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor ſoever the Natural Appetite can make afterwards, it is not capable to make her change the reſolution which ſhe had taken to ſuffer the ill, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being touched with the leaſt hope of being able to ſurmount it, reſolving herſelf to Patience, or abandoning her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Grief, and to thoſe Paſſions which follow it. But it's to ſtop too long on thoſe Subjects which muſt be handled again in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
                        <p>Let us onely clear two Doubts which may ariſe from the precedent propoſition; for if we often grow angry without Hope of ever getting ſatisfaction for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry received; And if even then when we are agitated with this Paſſion, we grow furious when we deſpair of our revenge, it muſt neceſſarily follow That Hope ought not alwayes to go
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47499:350"/>before or accompany Anger, as we have ſaid.</p>
                        <p>To anſwer to the firſt of theſe Reaſons,
<note place="margin">Every man that is angry hopes to revenge himſelf.</note> we muſt remember that in the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Vengeance is a chaſtiſement whereby we would take away from him who hath done us an injury the means to continue it. Now as no body makes himſelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, but he believes he hath that power; ſo neither is there any man but hopes to be revenged. And truly, all thoſe actions which proceed from this Paſſion, how ſlight ſoever they be, are puniſhments by which we pretend to chaſtiſe him who hath offended us, ſince there is not any but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords him Grief or Fear; for a bold and braſen-faced mind, an action full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and deſpight, and injurious words are able to diſpleaſe perſons even that are of the higheſt condition, and threats are for no other purpoſe but to fright thoſe againſt whom we make them.</p>
                        <p>Now if Grief and Fear are ills, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently puniſhments with which the Soul intends to chaſtiſe him who hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an injury, that he may do ſo no more, believing that they are able to change his mind; and that it's ſufficient to witneſs our Courage and reſentment, to make him even loſe the deſire of continuing his ill
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47499:350"/>deſign, and that he may imagine that their little eſſays are but the beginnings of a greater vengeance: It's thus that the wilde Beaſts commonly bound their anger with a ſlight ſnap, or a weak blow, and that they often content themſelves by affronting thoſe who purſue them, looking through them, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their teeth onely, and putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in poſture of aſſaulting them: And although the weakneſs the Soul is in checks her often from undertaking more, ſhe had rather act thus weakly then to take flight, which would be far more diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious; and by theſe motions which ſeem bold and generous, ſhe would hide her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and her defects, as in other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhe uſeth to do. How ever it be, ſhe never makes herſelf angry but ſhe hopes to be revenged, and to make him who hath offended her ſuffer ſome kinde of ill. But it follows not that ſhe ought always to hope for full ſatisfaction of the injury which ſhe thinks ſhe hath received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it commonly depends on the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, and not in the intention of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in effect, the means and the degrees of revenge are commonly different accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the humor and the condition of the perſons, and according to the cuſtoms of the Country. A Prince or a Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47499:351"/>himſelf after another manner then doth a Clown; a cruel and bloody minded Man is not ſo eaſily ſatisfied as another; and there are places where we believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſingle Duel no ſatisfaction can be had for an offence; and others where poiſon and aſſaſſination are commonly imployed. Now as it often happens that a man hath not the power to uſe thoſe means nor to purſue his vengeance to that height; it's moſt certain that then we deſpair to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it after that manner, but not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be unrevenged for the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and it's therefore true, that the hope of revenge always precedes Anger.</p>
                        <p>As for Deſpair,
<note place="margin">What kind of Deſpair it is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in Anger.</note> which ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens and renders it more violent, neither is that an abſolute loſs of hope, nor doth conclude againſt the Doctrine already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. For we ſhall ſhew in the Diſcourſe deſtined for that Paſſion, what the word Deſpair ſignifies in our Language as well as in the Greek and Latine; two Paſſions altogether different; to wit, the common deſpair wherein we loſe all hope, and wherein the Soul gives back and loſeth courage, perceiving that ſhe cannot obtain that good which ſhe expected; and that deſpair, or deſperateneſs which is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to Anger and Boldneſs, which inſtead
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:47499:351"/>of mollifying or abating the courage, ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens it againſt all difficulties with a greater impetuoſity and tranſport then it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For it's certain, that in this the Soul which findes obſtacles which ſhe never foreſaw, loſeth the hope of effecting what ſhe propoſed; but at the ſame time ſhe conceives another, and forms new deſigns which engage her in thoſe tranſports and fougadoes, which are commonly called actions of deſpair, as ſhall more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when we throughly diſcourſe on that ſubject.</p>
                        <p>Let's now take a view of the other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of this Paſſion, and without ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Confidence</hi> and at <hi>Preſumption,</hi> which have been examined in the Diſcourſe of Boldneſs, and depend on the ſame cauſes which produce Hope, let's enquire the nature and ſource of <hi>Fury,</hi> which ſo often mixeth it ſelf with Anger; for although they are often confounded together and that we commonly give the latter the name of Fury; yet they are two very different things, ſince there are Angers which are nothing furious, and that Fury is to be found in other Paſſions and in other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherein there is no ſuſpition of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>There are indeed divers ſorts of Furie,
<note place="margin">What fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is.</note>
                           <pb n="322" facs="tcp:47499:352"/>ſome have been called Divine, others Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and others have been placed in the rank of Diſeaſes. But all have this in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that they put the Soul out of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural place, and tranſport it as it were out of it ſelf; ſome making it perform actions beyond the ordinary ſtrength of men, and which for the ſame cauſe ſeem to have ſomething that's divine; the other cauſing him to loſe his Reaſon, and embaſing him to the nature of the wildeſt beaſts. It's not a place here to examine by retail all theſe differences; it ſhall be ſufficient to ſay, that this violent tranſport wherein the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this Fury in general conſiſts, may proceed either from the Soul which raiſeth up and animates herſelf, or from that heat which pricks her up, and irritates her; the fury of Love, and the Poetick Fury, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe which are divine, thoſe which commonly acknowledge no other cauſe but the Soul alone, which of herſelf raiſeth herſelf up, and makes thoſe miraculous ſallies which are as Enthuſiaſms and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpirations; for having the power to move herſelf, ſhe in thoſe encounters darts herſelf forth with ſo much ardor that ſhe carries herſelf away; and as he which runs with too much impetuoſity cannot ſtop himſelf, and often goes further then
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47499:352"/>he willingly would, ſhe abandons herſelf to the looſe which ſhe giveth herſelf, and ſo paſſeth beyond her ordinary limits: But it's not ſo in Martial and Bacchick Furies, nor in thoſe others which follow Anger or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſickneſſes. For it is not the Soul which begins this motion, wherewith ſhe is in theſe encounters carried away; it's the heat which the Wine, Boldneſs, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the body imprints in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which being agitated by this turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent quality, at every moment ſtrikes againſt the ſeat of the Animal Faculties, which drives them forth, and caſts them into theſe extraordinary motions. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the general reaſon whereby Anger paſſeth into Fury; for a man need not doubt but that this Paſſion kindles a great fire in the bowels, but that it violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitates in the ſpirits, and that the quiet which thoſe noble operations of the Soul require, muſt needs be trouled by that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt which ſhe raiſeth in their principal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; ſo that the Faculties which conduct the Animal, act no longer conformably to the Laws of Nature or of Reaſon, and having no longer a bridle to reſtrain them, are hurried away with the rapidity of the ſpirits and the Paſſion which drives them, and ſo perform all their actions
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47499:353"/>with diſorder and temerity. But what contributes much to this precipitation, it is Grief which is the firſt cauſe of Anger, and weakneſs which commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it; for both of them are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impatient and conſtrained, and eagerly ſollicite the Soul to provide for her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; that by reaſon that the ill is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; this becauſe it wants forces to reſiſt it, and that there is no time to be loſt in ſo dangerous and urgent an occaſion; and from thence it comes, that Anger is moſt impetuous in the weakeſt Natures; and that Fury kindles not it ſelf ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in all the reſt of the Paſſions as in this, for that they are commonly exempt from Grief and weakneſs, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there can be no cauſe for the Soul to haſten its endeavors for her defence; its true, that although robuſt Natures are not ſo ſoon tranſported as the reſt, as well for the reaſons already alleadged, as for that they are of a ſtronger and more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid complexion, wherein heat is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily catching: yet when once Fury hath ſeized on them, beſides that it is more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and more dangerous, it's alſo of a longer continuance, becauſe the heat is ſtronger, and is longer preſerved in groſs and maſſive ſubjects, then in ſuch as are
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47499:353"/>ſubtile and moveable, ſuch as are women and Children, and all thoſe who are of ſuch like a temperature.</p>
                        <p>Pride is ſo proper to Anger that there is no Paſſion it more often accompanies,
<note place="margin">Anger is proud.</note> nor with which it's ſo familiar; and certainly it's a ſtrange thing, that as ſoon as it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the weakeſt and vileſt Mind that may be, it takes away from it the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its baſeneſs and impotency, making it loſe all the reſpect it ought to others, and perſwading it neither to yield nor ſubmit to whatſoever it be. We need not go far for an example, ſince at every moment we may ſee that from its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels Servants dare confront their Maſters, Children their Parents, Subjects their Lords, and what is moſt frightful, ſuch vile creatures as men are, ſpare not the moſt holy things, but often wrack it on God himſelf; and although this diſcord appear not ſo great in perſons of a high conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they grow angry with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, yet they cannot forbear being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a very and unjuſt and odious Pride, when they will hear neither Reaſon nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, when ſilence or excuſes provoke them the more, and when a diſcovered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency is to them but as a new injury; for all this proceeds from the haughty
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47499:354"/>and proud Nature of this Paſſion which will always be in the right, and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on its ſide, which will never yield to any body, and will never acknowledge him for innocent, from whom it believes it hath received an offence, without ever accuſing it ſelf of impudence or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                        <p>But whence may this Pride come, which is often ſo ill grounded, and is commonly upheld neither by ſtrength nor reaſon? Certainly, we muſt not ſeek the ſource elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where then in the motion of heat, which troubles the judgment, and drives the Soul out of her ordinary limits, as is before ſaid. For Pride being nothing but a ſwelling, and as it were an immoderate extention of the Soul, whereby ſhe raiſeth herſelf up more then ſhe ought to do, and in purſuit eſteems her ſelf grearer then indeed ſhe is, it is impoſſible that heat ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked without giving her a very great confidence, without tranſporting her out of herſelf, and conſequently without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this exceſſive elevation wherein Pride Conſiſts.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the ſecret ſence which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath of the excellency of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which awakens him by the deſpight he believes he ſuffers by having been offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47499:354"/>for to repair this wrong which he thinks he hath received by being deſpiſed, he would lift himſelf up above him who abaſed him, and filling himſelf with a great opinion of himſelf, finds himſelf thus puft up with Arrogance and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p>Anger <hi>abounds in Words and in Threats,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Anger is talkative and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> becauſe the Fancy which is heated by the ardor ſhe kindles in the ſpirits, and which is full of ſuch thoughts as Pride and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance inſpire, is forced to caſt them out on the Tongue, and in its words; and truly we may ſay, that it is in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner like liquor which the heat of the fire cauſeth to riſe up in great boilings; for the fuller the veſſel is of it, the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily it riſeth above the brims, and ſo the more, and the more abundantly they iſſue out and ſhed themſelves. It's true, that Grief which is always to be found with this Paſſion, very much helps this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by that precipitation, and by that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience which it gives the Soul; for which cauſe Boldneſs alone loves not to talk ſo much as Anger, and we may ſee the ſame perſon who boldly without ſpeaking one word will go to fight, who having been offended cannot forbear to cry out and threaten, becauſe Grief at that time mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:47499:355"/>it ſelf with Boldneſs, which is as a ſpur unto it which ſtimulates it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords it a uſeleſs Fury: But if <hi>Weakneſs</hi> joyns alſo with them, Anger becomes ſo highly brawling, and riſeth to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of words and threats, that we may ſay that its at that time a torrent, which it's impoſſible to ſtop, as is to be obſerved in that of Women, of Children, and the like. Now this happens from that the Soul which knows its defect, hath a deſign to hide it by ſuch actions as ſeem coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and whereby ſhe thinks ſhe ought to fright her enemy; or from that Grief and weakneſs which are as we have ſaid, naturally unquiet and urgent, not giving her time to tempt more powerful means to revenge herſelf, cauſe her to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to theſe firſt arms of Nature, and cauſe her to diſſipate her courage in theſe vain aſſaults. And without doubt, he that will but conſider that Beaſts which are couragious, and Men who are bold and generous, uſe not to brawle or to talk much when they have been offended by any man, and that they ſeek their revenge, may well judge that cryings out, reaſons and threatnings are the natural defences of provoked weakneſs, and that thoſe who employ them, miſtruſt their own forces,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:47499:355"/>and reſemble thoſe thunders, which onely make a noiſe and are heard a long time after their lightnings vaniſh; for when a Bolt falls, the fire, the noiſe and the blow are reſented at once; and ſuch is that Anger which is kindled in great Courages and in ſtrong and robuſtious Conſtitutions, as hath been ſaid in the Diſcourſe of Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>From the ſame ſource whence the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of words comes,
<note place="margin">Anger is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet.</note> this <hi>indiſcreet Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> proceeds, which renders it ſo facile to diſcover its moſt ſecret thoughts; for there is no Paſſion which is ſo ill a Guardian of a ſecret as Anger; and although Love and Joy alſo are alike unfaithful as that is, yet they commit not the ſame vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the Heart; they rather open it then caſt it forth, and if they ſhed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, it's rather becauſe they fill it, then that they empty it; but Anger ſuffers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there which ſhe drives not out with force; it exhauſts it, by breaking it, and as a fire kindled in a Mine, it tears up and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers all what is hid therein. In effect, it's impoſſible to conceive the impetuoſity with which heat and the ſpirits iſſue out of the heart, and the violence with which the Soul throws herſelf forth for her revenge: but we muſt alſo fancy we ſee an effuſion and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering abroad of all her thoughts, and of all
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47499:356"/>her deſigns; and chiefly of thoſe which have conformity or alliance with Anger, as conſpiracies made with or againſt an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, thoſe ſecret good offices which have been done, and the like; which to ſatisfie its revenge, this Paſſion diſcovers. For when a man in anger reveals a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, in which his enemy was one of the complices, it's to bring him in danger; when he publiſheth an enterpriſe which he had formed againſt him, it's a threat; and when he reproacheth him, it's to convince him of wrong, and render him odious: They alſo are commonly the weakeſt which fall in this default, whether it be becauſe they ſpeak more, and that it's hard but that in many words much folly muſt needs be, or whether they would hide their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the liberty they take to ſpeak all they know, and all what they have a mind to do.</p>
                        <p>Yet there are ſome Angers which are <hi>Dumb,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Some An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are dumb.</note> and yet forbear not to be violent, although they make no noiſe; often even thoſe which are lowdeſt, ſtop on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and fall into a ſilence wherein Fury appears as high as in threatnings. Now this ſilence happens either from the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have in our own ſtrength, which ſeeks a more noble and a more ſolid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47499:356"/>then that of words, as we have ſaid in the Diſcourſe of Boldneſs, or from the deſpight we have of ſeeing our ſelves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by perſons from whom we expected not we could have received an injury, or from the ſcorn wherewith we pretend to chaſtiſe their inſolency; or from that ſtrong intention which the Soul gives her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to find out means of revenge to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the motive of the wrong done her, or for ſuch other like deſigns which Paſſion caſts into the thoughts.</p>
                        <p>It's <hi>impatient and conſtrained,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Anger is impatient</note> not onely by reaſon of the Grief it reſents, and of the deſire it hath of Revenge, which are two Paſſions naturally very unquiet, but alſo becauſe of the heat and of the agitation which it cauſeth in the ſpirits; for it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſble that theſe organs which ſerve the motions of the Soul and of the Body, ſhould ſuffer this great ebullition without powerfully agitating both of them, and in purſuit without cauſing trouble or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation in the thoughts, ſtrugling in the diſcourſe or in the looks, and a continual change of poſture and place which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in anger.</p>
                        <p>All Paſſions are <hi>credulous</hi> in thoſe things which favor their deſign,
<note place="margin">Anger is opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> and <hi>opinionated</hi> in thoſe which reſiſt them, becauſe it's
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47499:357"/>eaſie to drive the Soul whether ſhe would go, and dfficult to make her take a new courſe: But as there is none ſo impetuous nor ſo rapid as Anger, there is none alſo in which perſwaſions are more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to haſten its courſe, or wherein ſuch as would oppoſe it are more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputed. Indeed we can propoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a man agitated with this Paſſion which may render the injury which he hath received greater or more ſenſible, which may advance or encreaſe his revenge, and which flatters his deſign and proceedings, but he greedily receives it, and affords it a ready approbation. On the contrary, he ſtiffens himſelf againſt all thoſe reaſons which endeavor to ſweeten his reſentment and his fury; and although he acknowledg the truth and juſtice of them, yet he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to combate them, and believes that his opinionacy is able to juſtifie his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>Yet he that would near-hand but conſider all their actions, will perceive that Pride bears a great part in them, and that beſides this general cauſe which we have now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, this alſo particularly contributes thereunto: For Pride loves to be flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will always be in the right, and never yields to whomſoever it be. So that we
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47499:357"/>need not wonder if Anger which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proud, eaſily hearkens to thoſe who approve and favor its deſigns, if it repulſe thoſe who condemn it, and if it continue ſledfaſt in its reſolutions, when even it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth them unjuſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cowardlineſs,

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47499:358"/>not properly effects of this Paſſion, they are rather kindes and differences of it; for they are light Angers which ſeem to keep themſelves almoſt quite ſhut up in the Soul, and which never fall into thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies and violences which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable in the others. All three have this in common, That Grief is always mixt with them, and that they ſtir up the Soul againſt thoſe things which give them any diſpleaſure. But there is this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Diſdain is never without Scorn, although we have a deſpight and an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt ſuch things as we eſteem. On the other ſide, Indignation never is but in Men, although the other two are alſo to be found in Beaſts. To conclude, it's certain that there are perſons whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe without having any diſdain or indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt them.</p>
                        <p>And certainly the word <hi>Indignation</hi> means,
<note place="margin">What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation is.</note> that to raiſe this motion in the Soul, ſomething muſt happen to a man which he deſerves not, and which he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of; now as we may grieve for the good or ill which ſo happens, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be to know whether either of them be capable to raiſe it, or whether it be good onely, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> believes; For his thought is that the Grief we have to ſee
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:47499:358"/>him who deſerves it not to ſuffer ill, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth compaſſion; and that which we have to ſee thoſe proſper which are unworthy of it, cauſeth ndignation. But this ſeems not to agree with that ſignification which all Languages give that word, nor even with the Nature of the thing: Foraſmuch as the Soul may two ways grieve for the ill it ſees thoſe ſuffer who deſerve it not, to wit by compaſſionating onely their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, without employing its forces to combate the ill; or elſe by raiſing and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf up againſt it to repell it. Now it's certain that Compaſſion is altogether without this commotion, taking care one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to flye the ill and being quite plunged in Grief and Fear, as we ſhall ſhew in its place; And therefore if the Soul makes any effort when ſhe is angry with the ill which happens to any man undeſervedly, ſince this motion can neither be compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor pity, it muſt needs be a kinde of indignation. Indeed the common manner of ſpeaking teacheth us that there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who cannot ſee their enemies without indignation. That their words are full of indignation and threatnings; that God chaſtiſeth the wicked in the Anger of his Indignation, and even that we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in indignation againſt our ſelves. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:47499:359"/>Languages alſo uſe the word in the ſame ſence, for the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath placed for this, hath a larger ſignification then he hath given it, and may be as well applied to the indignation which we conceive ſeeing a man too ill uſed, as for that we may have for him who is uſed but too well. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect himſelf confeſſeth that this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is attributed to God, who yet ought not to be in indignation for the proſperity of the wicked, becauſe it's he who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth it to them, but juſtly becauſe they abuſe it and uſe it unvvorthily by their crimes and by their ingratitude. And truly we muſt not ſtick at all at what this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Author hath ſaid of the Paſſions in his Rhetorick, in vvhich he hath treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them but ſuperficially and in moſt common notions. For its certain, that had he throughly examined them, he vvould have made tvvo ſorts of <hi>Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the one vvhich the good of another begets in us, and that vvhich happens from the ill vvhich vve ſuffer or ſee others ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and that the true and onely motive vvhich provokes them is Indignity; for vvithout that there can be no Indignation; it's Deſpight, it's Envy, or the like. So vvhen vve are angry at the good vvhich
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:47499:359"/>happens to a man, if vve do not conſider him as unvvorthy of it, it's Envy; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ill muſt be alvvays unjuſt vvhich moves us to Anger, if we do not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly look on it as an indignity, it may well beget Deſpight, or ſuch a kind of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but never Indignation: for which cauſe the motion which the Soul ſuffers in this encounter, runs not into thoſe violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and exceſſes which true Anger is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away withal; becauſe the real ill which cauſeth Grief conſiſts not in this Indignity, but in the Injuſtice which out of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration being a ſtranger unto it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it. So that if the Injury for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample-ſake is not great, what indignity ſoever you may conceive, it obligeth not the Soul to make any great endeavors, foraſmuch as it is but as a colour which ſhe gives herſelf to the body and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ill, which in ſome manner renders it more ſenſible, though not the greater. And it's alſo for this reaſon that Beaſts are not ſuſceptible of it, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make ſuch reflections as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to know whether one is not worthy of a thing; Beſides men are in indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſee good or ill happen to thoſe who deſerve it not, becauſe it is a thing which
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:47499:360"/>ſeems unjuſt, and that naturally we have an averſion againſt what is oppoſite to Reaſon and Juſtice; but how ever we intereſs our ſelves ſo much for them, we often abandon them in the Judgement which we make of the merit of perſons, whom we often eſteem worthy or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of things according as Pride, Love, or Hatred counſel it.</p>
                        <p>For which reaſon Ambitious perſons and Lovers are extreamly ſubject to this Paſſion, for as much as Vanity eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades thoſe that all other men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of thoſe Honors which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire unto; and that Love gives a high eſteem to thoſe of the perſon beloved, and a great opinion of their ſervice, for in that, though at every moment they find cauſe of offence, or are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently eſteemed, or elſe from that they are not well uſed, or that others are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſed, who as they think deſerve it not ſo well: On the contrary, thoſe who are of a ſervile mind, or baſe ſpirit, and are not capable of any noble deſire, they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt never reſent the motions of Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<note place="margin">What Diſdain is.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Diſdain</hi> is alſo a kind of Anger, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to provoke it there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:47499:360"/>which diſpleaſeth, and muſt cauſe the Soul to riſe up againſt it. But what renders it different from the reſt is, that Scorn which ever accompanies it; for we never diſdain any man but we ſcorn him, although we ſcorn many things which we do not diſdain. So that we may ſay Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain is a ſcornful Anger; and thence it is that it never is violent or impetuous, becauſe thoſe things which we ſcorn deſerve not that we ſhould trouble our ſelves for them: Not that what we diſdain is always ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or elſe the Soul would never care to riſe up againſt it, ſince Scorn is nothing but the opinion which we have that a thing is unworthy of our eſteem and of our care, not judging it capable to do good or hurt, as is before ſaid. And therefore it muſt needs be, that what we ought to diſdain may do ſome ill, but that its power is not ſo great, or at leaſt that we feign we fear it not: For it often happens in theſe Paſſions, that the Soul which knows its weakneſs endeavours to hide it by actions, which ſeem outragious, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Deſpight,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">What De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight is</note> it hath nothing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which diſtinguiſheth it from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as the former have; for it's but a
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:47499:361"/>weak Anger, and as it were a ſlight throw which the Soul to oppoſe ill gives it ſelf, whether it be becauſe it's of ſmall concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or becauſe ſhe dares not or will not ſtrongly aſſault it: For weakneſs common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrains it and hinders it from driving the Paſſion whether it ought to go; And Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which is not Miſtris of the firſt motions of the Appetite ſuffers Deſpight well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as the beginnings of Anger, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it not to go any further; for which cauſe timerous perſons, and thoſe who are moderate deſpiſe thoſe things which in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would kindle Anger it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Characters</hi> which Anger imprints on the body,
<note place="margin">The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Anger.</note> mark out alſo the ſame mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe two Paſſions of which we have ſhewn they were compoſed: For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but a ſad and crabbed mind which it ſheds over the face, ſighs and crys which at every moment it caſts forth, and thoſe tears which it ſo often vents, proceed from Grief; and that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor which appears in the Eyes, in the voice, and in all its motions, proceeds from Boldneſs; it's true, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly produceth thoſe which are moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and more in number then the other, becauſe it cauſeth the Soul to iſſue out, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47499:361"/>to diſcover it ſelf; inſtead whereof Grief making her retire within herſelf, cauſeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the greater parts of its effects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main hid, and not to appear as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do. And certainly, in that number of corporal Characters which are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Anger, there are but three or four which depend on Grief, all the reſt comming from Boldneſs and from Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                        <p>But from what ſource ſoever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their origine, we muſt not forget that ſome are made by the order and command of the Soul, and that the reſt happen out of a meer neceſſity, ſhe having no deſign nor intention to produce them, as is the paleneſs and redneſs of the Face, the wrinckles of the Forehead, the ſwelling of the parts, ſtammering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they ſerve for no other purpoſe in the deſign of Anger, and they are onely formed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the motion of the ſpirits, and of the reſt of the parts.</p>
                        <p>Now as there being many of both of theſe which have been examined in the foregoing Diſcourſes, which we intend not to touch any more; It ſhall ſuffice to let the Reader know that in the Chapter of Boldneſs he may finde the cauſes of that
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:47499:362"/>through-look, the motion of the Lids, Brows and Forehead, the widening of the Noſtrils, the ſtanding of the Hair, and that paleneſs which ſometimes happens in the beginning of Anger; That in the Chapter of Love, he may ſee whence ſighs ſpring, and why the ruddineſs which that Paſſion raiſeth begins at the Eyes; He ſhall in that of Conſtancy know whence the firmneſs of the parts proceeds. As for Tears, and other effects of Grief, we ſhall ſpeak of them in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which we have deſtined for that Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the Through-look there are two others which are familiar to Anger, to wit, a Fierce Look, and a Furious Look. Both of which have that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that they are made with force and vivacity. But the Fierce one hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is ſad and ſevere, which is not always to be encountred in the Furious, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo that it is not ſo ardent and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering as is this.</p>
                        <p>To render the <hi>Look Fierce,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Whence the fierce look comes.</note> the Brows muſt lowre, and gather themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Eye muſt be quick and piercing, and the Sight firm and aſſured; Such is that of Lions, of Leopards, and of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffs,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:47499:362"/>for they naturally have their Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows caſt down and reſtrained, which makes as it were a great cloud in the Forehead, and their Eyes have a certain ardor which ſeem to breath forth blood and ſlaughter. And certainly there needs no leſs then theſe three conditions to compoſe ſuch a kinde of Look: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as an Impudent man may well have firmneſs and vivacity in his looks; but becauſe he archeth up his Brows, and that rude and ſevere air which proceeds from the contraction of the Brows and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is wanting to him, he therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a fierce look. On the other ſide, Frowardneſs and a ſtrong attention of mind may cauſe this ſeverity to appear in the Face; but becauſe they take away vivacity from the Eyes, they never render the Look fierce. That piercing ſplendor indeed which appears in the Eyes, and chiefly in thoſe which are blew, which the Latins call <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſios,</hi> inſpires ſomewhat of cruel and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the look, for which cauſe <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls the Germans eyes <hi>Truces;</hi> and we are taught that Panthers and Leopards, have I know not what kind of fierceneſs in theirs, which the Lyons have not; by reaſon that they have that colour, and that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:47499:363"/>the Eyes of theſe are altogether red, which colour is more obſcure and leſs ſplendent.</p>
                        <p>However it be, Anger <hi>caſts down and bonds the Brows</hi> to fortifie it ſelf againſt the Grief it reſents, and againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which aſſaults it, as hath been ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. It's Look is <hi>quick and aſſured,</hi> by reaſon of that ſplendor and ſtrength which it caſts into the eyes by the quantity of ſpirits which it ſends thither. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but that the firmneſs of the ſight muſt be an effect of the ſtrength of the parts, and that the ſpirits muſt make the greateſt part of their ſtrength, ſince they become languiſhing when they receive them no more. To know wherein this firmneſs of ſight conſiſts, we muſt conſider what hath been ſaid concerning it in the Chapter of Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>Although the <hi>Furious Look</hi> is often taken for the fierce,
<note place="margin">What a furious Look is.</note> yet is it not the ſame; for there is a great difference betwixt the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary looks of a Lyon, and thoſe which he hath when he is provoked: Betwixt the look of a man who is yet Maſter of his Anger, and that he hath when madded and enraged; that is fierce, but this is furious, and witneſſeth an extream tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and a very ſtraggling away of the Soul;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:47499:363"/>it's made alſo with red and ſparkling eyes, which ſhout forth and ſeem to go out of the Head, and which rowling from the one ſide to the other cauſe a wilde and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſight; and as in the other the brows are bent downwards, in this they are commonly lifted up, and drawing their lids after them they make the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eyes to be wider and rounder, and ſo diſcover almoſt all the white of the eye. Now all theſe Characters are ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Fury, that even Phyſitians make uſe of them to know when the ſick perſon will fall into ſuch a fit, and that it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conſider the ſtate wherein the ſoul then is without perceiving that neceſſarily ſhe muſt produce an effect.</p>
                        <p>For as the blood boils in the veſſels,
<note place="margin">Red Eys.</note> and impetuouſly caſts it ſelf on all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts, all the veins of the Eyes are filled therewith, and conſequently become thicker and redder, for which cauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that thoſe who naturally have theirs ſo, are ſubject to that kind of furious Anger whereof we ſpeak, and that this relates to the proper character of this Paſſion; but you muſt obſerve that this redneſs ought principally to be underſtood of the Eye, and not of the Lids, &amp; that the veins which are
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47499:364"/>diſperſed in the blew of the Eye are thoſe which are ſwelled, and which cauſe that redneſs, which alſo is a ſign of raving in ſickneſs, when it proceeds not from any particular vice of thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Eyes are ſparkling,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Eyes.</note> not onely by reaſon of that ſplendor which the ſpirits bring with them, but alſo by reaſon of the approach of thoſe vapors which the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors caſts on thoſe organs, which exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Membrane which environs them, render it more united, more poliſhed, and more fit to reverberate the light which they receive. Add alſo that the continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith they are agitated makes them ſparkle and gliſter the more: to which we may alſo add, that their Drineſs renders their brightneſs more quick and peircing; it being certain that humidity dims the light, and that the refraction it makes there weakens the rayes, inſtead that on dry and poliſhed bodies it's reflected and reverberated all whole and pure; for which cauſe in Love and in Joy, how ſparkling ſoever the eyes be, by reaſon of their humidity, yet they have not ſo ſtrong and ſo penetrating a ſplendor as theſe have.</p>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:47499:364"/>
                        <p>But whence doth this <hi>drineſs</hi> proceed? Is it not from the vehemency of the heat which conſumes all the humour which runs over the Eyes, or rather ſharp and drying vapors which riſe from that cholerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which is agitated? for where-ever they arrive, they render the skin dry and parched, as is obſervable in burning Feavors and in cholerick conſtitutions.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this,
<note place="margin">Fiery Eyes.</note> the ſplendor we have ſpoken of, mixing it ſelf with that colour which the blood brought to thoſe parts, produceth an enflamed redneſs, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the <hi>Eyes fiery,</hi> even like unto coals of fire.</p>
                        <p>They <hi>caſt themſelves forth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Eyes advance outwards</note> whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they receive a great quantity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, of vapor, and of blood, they ſwell, and ſo are conſtrained to occupy the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er room; or becauſe the ſpirits which iſſue out with impetuoſity, drive thoſe parts out of their natural ſcituation; or finally, becauſe the Soul which is carried out of her ſelf draws them along with her, and cauſeth them to make a ſally like her own.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wandering Eyes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Eyes are wandering.</note> which continually move their ſight here and there, without fixing on any object, make a part of this furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous look, and it's principally what renders
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47499:365"/>them frightful and formidable, for which cauſe thoſe who have treated of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Beaſts, ſay, that the Panther which after this manner always rowls its Eyes, hath a more terrible and frightful look then any other, and that there is no Beaſt how fierce or bold ſoever it be, which it doth not fright and terrifie therewithal. However when the ſight becomes thus wandering in ſickneſs, it's a certain ſign that the party is falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fury. Yet we muſt obſerve, that fear alſo produceth the ſame effect, and often renders the looks wilde and inconſtant; but beſides that the air of the Face which accompanies thoſe Paſſions, may alone ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a great difference betwixt thoſe looks, it's moſt certain that they are effectually different from one the other, neither are they made in the ſame manner. For fear cauſeth us to caſt our eyes on this and on that ſide; but how light or quick ſoever the motion it affords them is, it for a while ſtops them on thoſe objects which preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and it appears clearly, that it ſeeks them to conſider them, and to ſee whether it be from them the ill muſt happen which ſhe fears. But fury without deſign carries the ſight here and there, and without heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it encounters, caſts the eyes on
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47499:365"/>things without ſeeing them, and all its looks are loſt looks, and truly wandering. Now theſe motions partly come from heat, which is a moving quality, and when it's provoked it puts all in diſorder, partly from that agitation which the ſpirits ſuffer, which eaſily communicates it ſelf to the Eyes, being as they are moving, partly from the Souls tranſport which abandons the conduct of thoſe organs, and ſuffers them to move at the pleaſure of the tempeſt which ſhe raiſed.
<note place="margin">The Brows are not knit.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>And according to my opinion its alſo the reaſon why the <hi>Brows are not ſhrunk up,</hi> as in the fierce look; for ſince their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction is an effect of that care which the Soul takes to fortifie herſelf, which ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alſo preſerves ſo long as ſhe is herſelf, when ſhe is once carried away with fury, and that ſhe is as it were out of herſelf, ſhe then loſeth the remembrance of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and hath no other motions but thoſe which the blindneſs and madneſs of the Paſſion gives: For which cauſe when ſhe darts &amp; impetuouſly caſts herſelf out of her natural ſituation, ſhe draws with her the moſt movable parts, and ſo cauſeth the Brows and Lids to lift themſelves up, in purſuit wherof the openings of the eyes muſt not onely be greater, but they muſt alſo-become <hi>rounder,</hi>
                           <pb n="350" facs="tcp:47499:366"/>becauſe the Lid cannot open much but its angles muſt be widened, which muſt alſo be drawn the nearer to one another to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate this extention which is made in the circumference. Now beſides that this cauſeth a round figure, a greater part of the white of the Eye muſt alſo appear, which renders the look more ſtrange and dreadful.</p>

                        <p>But whence comes their <hi>trembling,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Lips tremble.</note> and principally that of the lower Lip? Is it not that the ſpirits crackle in thoſe parts, and cauſe that part which is extreamly movable to tremble? or that the Choler which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, pricks the ſtomack, which hath a great ſympathy with the neather Lip; whence it is that in ſickneſs the trembling of that part is a ſign of vomiting.
<note place="margin">The Lips preſs one another.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sometimes they <hi>joyn</hi> and <hi>preſs</hi> one the other, to retain breath, and thereby to render the motion the more ſtrong; or to fortifie thoſe parts which grow hard and ſtiff by the contraction of the Muſcles, as hath been ſaid in the Chapter of Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>They alſo ſometimes <hi>retire</hi> themſelves,
<note place="margin">The Lips retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> and diſcover the teeth, which moſt part of Beaſts uſually do when they are angry, becauſe thoſe are their natural Arms, which they diſcover to fright thoſe who vvould offend them, or to be the readier to make uſe of them. This is alſo obſerved in ſome perſons, vvhen they fall into a rage,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:47499:367"/>and faſten on the fleſh of any one, whether it be that the Soul makes this endeavor, thinking to fortifie herſelf, as ſhe doth by knitting the Brows, or whether in effect ſhe would with her teeth tear in peices, and if ſhe could even devour her enemy. For there are men who grind their teeth, who in their anger bite what they meet withal, and who would eat the heart and bowels of thoſe who have done them an injury.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Voice</hi> is <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi> becauſe Anger being compoſed of Grief and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<note place="margin">What the Voice is in Anger.</note> this with impetuoſity driving the air which is in the Lungs, and Grief reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Muſcles, and ſtreightning the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, ſo that the voice muſt needs become ſhrill, paſſing through ſo ſtreight a channel, and being driven out with vehemency, muſt needs alſo be ſtrong. But there are two Propoſitions, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath made in his Phyſionomy, which may make us doubt whether this voice be that which principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs to Anger. The firſt is that which is groſs at firſt, and at laſt grows ſharp, is the ſign of a cholerick perſon, and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Oxen, and to the likeneſs of their voice. Indeed when theſe Beaſts bellow, their voice at laſt grows ſharp, and hath ſomewhat in it which is ſad and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and even in men, affliction and grief
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:47499:367"/>in complaints form the ſame air, and the ſame languor. Now if this be ſo, the voice of Anger is not as we ſaid ſtrong and vehement.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, That thoſe who have a ſharp and vehement Voice are cholerick, and that this relates to Goats; But beſides that theſe creatures have not that kind of Voice, they were never obſerved to be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that Paſſion: we muſt therefore ſay, that there is an error in thoſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions by the fault of the Tranſlators: for in the firſt, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſignifies not Anger, as they have tranſlated it, but ſad languiſhing, caſt down for matter of courage, and in that ſence it's true, that the Voice which is groſſe at firſt and ſharp at laſt, is a ſign of ſadneſs, as we ſhall ſhew in the Chapter of Grief. In the laſt there is alſo the ſame fault in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which ſignifies not Anger, but rather Laſciviouſneſs, which is indeed a quality proper to Goats. Add alſo that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſignifies not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a ſtrong and vehement Voice, but a forced and conſtrained Voice, ſuch as is the bleating of Goats, as ſhall be ſaid in its place.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Voice</hi> becomes <hi>hoarſe</hi> by the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47499:368"/>of its organs;
<note place="margin">The Voice is hoarſe.</note> for heat melting the humors and making them run on thoſe parts, it renders them moiſt and unequal, and the voice which it utters is rude, and ſounds not; and becauſe that vehemency is joyned with this ſharpneſs thence it is it becomes terrible and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">The Voice ſtops all at once.</note> Sometimes it <hi>ſtops</hi> all at once in deſpight of ones teeth, whether it be that the violence wherewith it drives the breath, quickly clears the Lungs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives the Heart of its refreſhings; and that in this neceſſity the Soul making haſte to cauſe a new attraction of the air, the Voice is conſtrained to ſtop to give it paſſage. Or whether the Nerves which help to form it, ſuffer a kind of convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being pricked by thoſe Humors which heat agitates, as it happens to children which cry, whoſe voice and reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration leaps, and ſo cut and ſuddenly ſtop themſelves.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Tongue faulters,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Tongue faulters.</note> either by reaſon of the quantity of blood which thickens it, or renders it heavy, or by reaſon of drineſs which hinders its motion; or by reaſon of the Souls tranſport which ſends
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:47499:368"/>the Spirits elſewhere, and hinders them from having recourſe to thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Words interfare</hi> by the haſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity which the Soul cauſeth,

                           <hi>Laughter</hi> is often an effect of Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or of Scorn,
<note place="margin">Laughter in Anger.</note> which are mixed with Anger, as we ſaid it happened to Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but commonly it comes from the malignant pleaſure we have in Revenge; yet the Temperature contributes much to this effect: For Septentrional people have almoſt the ſame air in fight, and we may ſee them aſſault their Enemies with a certain inſolent Fierceneſs, and with I know not what kind of ſcoffing Laughter; inſtead whereof the Southern people car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their Countenance a fierce Frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardneſs, and a ſharp and cruel Sadneſs; the reaſons whereof ſhall in its place be diſcovered.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Redneſs</hi> which this Paſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly raiſeth up in the Face is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like that which Joy,
<note place="margin">The Face becomes red.</note> Shame and ſome other Paſſions ſhed abroad in it; it is far more clear and leſs vermilion then in this, for that it proceeds from a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick blood, whoſe colour is more pale, by reaſon the tincture of the Gall which
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:47499:369"/>weakens the ſplendor and Vermilion of the Blood, and cauſeth this inflamed Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is viſible in the Face and Breaſt of thoſe who are angry. It alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens that it becomes obſcure and blackiſh, and this chiefly is when Anger is turned into Fury; for the agitation is then ſo great that the thickeſt blood is caſt on the outward parts which affords it its natural colour, and paints them of that black and livid colour which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on the Cheecks and on the Lips, becauſe they are the moſt ſanguine parts of the Face. As for that paleneſs which ſometimes happens at the beginning of this Paſſion, we have ſpoken of it in the Chapter of Boldneſs.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not ſtay long on the moſt part of the reſt of the Characters which this Paſſion imprints on the body; the reaſons are eaſily found by thoſe principles which we have eſtabliſhed. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember the impetuoſity and the boilings wherwith the blood and ſpirits are agited, but we muſt preſently judge, that that is the cauſe which makes <hi>the Veins and Arteries ſwelled and extended,</hi> and that all the reſt of the parts are <hi>full and puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:47499:370"/>up,</hi> and whoſoever ſhall repreſent to himſelf the impatience and the tranſport wherein the Soul is, will nothing wonder at theſe motions which in this Paſſion the Body ſuffers.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Head is lifted up,</hi> and <hi>the Stature grows erect,</hi> for as much as the Soul raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up herſelf to aſſault the Enemy. And although he be abſent ſhe forbears not to put herſelf into this poſture, as if ſhe were ready to throw herſelf on him, for that the violence of thoſe Paſſions which trouble her repreſent him to her thought as if he were truly preſent, and as if he ought in effect to feel the blows ſhe intends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict.</p>
                        <p>The frequent <hi>flinging out of the Arms,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts in Anger.</note> a light and quick pace, a continual change of poſture and place, are effects which note the endeavors and ſallies of the Soul, the precipitation and impatience ſhe hath to revenge herſelf.</p>
                        <p>But whence comes it that <hi>we ſet up our Hands by our ſides,</hi> when with anger and threatnings we quarrel with any man? it is without doubt to confirm the parts that
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:47499:370"/>the Muſcles of reſpiration which they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold may the more powerfully operate, and by that means the voice may have the more force and be the longer laſting. For which cauſe we are never content to place our hands thus on our ſides, but that we alſo advance the Arms and the Elbows, whereby enlarging and extending the Shoulders we render them for the ſame purpoſe more ſtiff.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe blows wherewith a man in Anger <hi>beats the ground,</hi> and all what comes under his hands or under his feet, it's very likely that they are ſuch means as the ſoul uſeth to give a repulſe to thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which traverſe her deſigns; and that the trouble and blindneſs ſhe is in cauſing her to take all things for true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles which ſtop her, ſhe ſtrikes againſt, ſhe drives, and ſhe beats them, as it were to break them and to put them by, or elſe they are the effects of a precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Vengeance which Anger doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge on the firſt Objects it meets, having not either the patience or the power to make them be reſcued by its real Enemy. It's thus that Dogs bite the ſtones which are thrown at them; it is
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:47499:371"/>thus we break the Sword which wounded us; in a word, it is thus we revenge our ſelves on our ſelves, and above all, its what concerns thoſe from whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an injury.</p>
                        <p>But what reaſon can we give for all thoſe <hi>ſhakings of the Head</hi> which are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this Paſſion?
<note place="margin">Whence the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of the Head.</note> What can oblige the Soul to move it one while to the right, and then to the left, ſometimes up and ſometimes down, and ſometimes on one ſide onely? And to what end doth ſhe cauſe theſe ſo extravagant motions, and ſo different the one from another? For to conclude that they are ſigns and natural effects which Anger produceth in all men of what Nation or of what conſtitution ſoever they are; So that if Nature doth nothing in vain, ſhe muſt herein have her cauſes and reaſons as well as in her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt conſiderable actions. It is true, in my judgement, they are very hard to be known, and it is with them as with moſt part of things which hide them ſelves ſo much the more unto the Mind, the more they diſcover themſelves unto the Sences, and which are as difficult to be comprehended as they are eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:47499:371"/>And certainly as all natural things are made for ſome end, or out of neceſſity; we cannot ſay but that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Body, or the agitation of the Humors muſt cauſe theſe motions by a neceſſary conſequence, as it happens in the redneſs of the Face, in the wrinckles of the Forehead, in the ſplendor of the Eyes, and the like, which are formed by neceſſity, without being deſtined for any uſe; and if we would place them in the rank of actions which are performed for ſome end: it is nothing eaſie to obſerve what motive the Soul therein propoſeth it ſelf, no, what ſervice ſhe pretends to draw from thence.</p>
                        <p>To give further light to theſe obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, you muſt firſt know whether theſe motions are not in other Paſſions, and afterwards ſeek thoſe motives for the which they were therein formed; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee whether they may be applied to Anger.</p>
                        <p>It is certain that we uſe to <hi>ſhake the Head</hi> and to give it readily two or three turns about, when any thing diſpleaſeth,
<note place="margin">Why we toſs the Head.</note> as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when we refuſe or diſapprove of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47499:372"/>any thing, when we are ſenſible of an ungrateful ſmel, or when we taſt ought that is diſguſtful. For which cauſe the vulgar commonly call Wine when it is not good, Wine with two ears, becauſe it makes thoſe two parts move when we turn the Head from one ſide to the other, and that by that motion we would ſignifie that we found it to be naught. But what relation can this action have with theſe ſentiments? Is it not that the Soul would turn away the face where the organs of the ſences are, from thoſe objects which are diſpleaſing to it, as ſhe uſeth to fix them on thoſe which pleaſe; Or that ſhe ſeeks by that endeavor to eſtrange from her what is troubleſome? At leaſt it is thus, that when any thing incommodates thoſe parts we ſhake them about to drive them away; for although this in theſe encounters we ſpeak of be uſeleſs unto it, yet are they nothing extraordinary, ſince ſhe often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives herſelf in the ſame manner upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions, wherein ſhe abuſeth thoſe means which Nature hath preſcribed her to attain her ends, employing them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers where they are of no uſe, as hath been ſhewed, ſpeaking of that water which Deſire cauſeth in the Mouth, and of the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47499:372"/>motion of the Brows at the ſight of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſteful things. Or we may rather ſay, that this ſhaking of the Head is a mark the Soul would make of the impreſſion which ſome kind of objects make on her, and that it is an outward image of that action which ſhe performs in herſelf: For it is her cuſtom that when ſhe would have that appear outwardly which is done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhe cauſeth thoſe motions of the organs which have ſome relation and reſemblance with her own, as we may judge by the laughter of the looks, and by all thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects whereof we have ſpoken in this Work.</p>
                        <p>And certainly, ſince that at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of pleaſant things ſhe makes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſigns which make known the ſence ſhe hath of them, ſhe muſt needs alſo have ſome for thoſe which are diſpleaſing. So that if ſhe <hi>ſweetly caſts down the Head</hi> when good preſents it ſelf unto her (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when we meet a friend, when we approve a good action, or when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the will or advice of another) to ſignifie by this caſting down that ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits herſelf to the good which by reaſon of its excellency, and becauſe it always
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47499:373"/>communicates it ſelf with ſome empire, can never be but with ſome ſubmiſſion and allowance; it muſt needs be I ſay by the reaſon of contraries, that when ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives any ill, ſhe who hath a natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from it, which in its preſence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſquiets its ſelf, and with which ſhe can never have any ſociety or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, muſt alſo make ſome outward motion which repreſents her impatience, and the endeavor ſhe makes to eſtrange herſelf from it. Now he that ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhaking of the Head which we ſpeak of, will eaſily confeſs that there is none which can better expreſs her averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, her diſquiet, and the care ſhe takes not to unite herſelf with it; for averſion cauſeth the turn away of the Head; impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience makes the change of poſture, and thoſe contrary and redoubled motions make it appear that ſhe will not unite with it, ſince union in natural things, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made by a ſimple and uniform mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if there be no obſtacle which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this it will be nothing difficult to declare why Anger produceth the ſame effect, ſince it hath the ſame object which
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:47499:373"/>the reſt of the Paſſions have, and that it cannot conſider its enemy but as a vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ill, for the which it hath an averſion, and whereunto it will ever witneſs the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it bears, and the impatience it hath to revenge it ſelf. In effect, this ſhaking of the Head, is a kind of threat whereby we intend to fright people, and which is not made uſe of in fight, or when we come to blows; threatnings being then uſeleſs, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                        <p>As for the other motion of the Head upwards,
<note place="margin">Why we lift up the Head.</note> it is but little obſervable in this Paſſion, unleſs when it would witneſs the ſcorn which it conceives of advice given it, or of the deſigns and threatnings of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. In effect, it is a Character fit for Scorn, for him to whom we propoſe a thing which he ſlights, uſually to lift up his Noſe, to witneſs thereby that he rejects and repels it as unworthy of his eſteem and care.</p>
                        <p>Finally,
<note place="margin">Why we turn the Head.</note> Anger often cauſeth a man <hi>to turn and lift his Head on one ſide,</hi> chiefly when he cannot or will not be revenged: For when we receive an injury from a powerful perſon, and have not the power
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:47499:374"/>to demand ſatisfaction we cauſe our reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to appear by that action, which is familiar to children that have a courage, after they have been ill uſed, as alſo thoſe who form a deſign to revenge themſelves when their enemy is abſent or far off; Becauſe thoſe are not then in a capacity to execute their revenge by reaſon of their weakneſs, nor theſe by reaſon of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or far diſtance of him who hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them. On the other ſide, when for ſome certain conſideration a man will not revenge himſelf although he may, as when we eſteem the injury not very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or that thoſe who have done it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a more ſevere chaſtiſement, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with this motion of the Head to cauſe ſome fear in them. And certainly it is in the rank of thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſerve for threatnings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Soul intends a diſpleaſure or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion in thoſe who have offended her, making them believe that thoſe ſlight puniſhments are but the beginnings of a greater vengeance, as hath been ſaid: However it be ſhe intends thereby to make known that the injury toucheth her; and that ſhe means to retort it; but that ſhe retains this Paſſion, and gives it not the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:47499:374"/>liberty to go further; for it turns the head to witneſs averſion; it lifts it up to ſignifie its endeavor, and preſently brings it into its firſt poſture to ſhew that it hath no more to do, and that its enough for it to have witneſſed its courage and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Some perhaps may ſay, That we often perform the ſame action, when we finde a thing to be excellent, as when we would declare that a thing is well done, that a man hath ſome eminent vertue, that Wine is extreamly good.</p>
                        <p>To which we muſt anſwer, That there is a great deal of difference betwixt theſe two; For beſides that in this we never turn the Head, it is not thrown, but as we have ſaid it is rather drawn and raiſed up, neither falls it again ſo ſoon as in Anger; becauſe its admiration which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this motion, which raiſing up the Soul and keeping it in ſuſpence to conſider the wonder ſhe incounters, diſpoſeth of the organs conformable to the condition ſhe is then in: Whereunto muſt alſo be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the ſubject of admiration which here occupies the Mind is but mean; for when its very great, it not onely cauſeth a man to lift up the Head on one ſide;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:47499:375"/>but he lifts it up altogether, he opens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Eyes and his Mouth, raiſeth and extends his Arms and all his parts take ſuch an extatick figure which uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies thoſe great tranſports and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Soul, as ſhall be ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But let us conclude this enquiry which to many may ſeem of no uſe, or too much ſcruple; and let us ſee whether Anger may be lulled aſleep, and whether it affords any releaſe to the Mind, whilſt the Body is at reſt.</p>
                        <p>We cannot doubt but that if <hi>Sleep</hi> can hardly inſinuate it ſelf in thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which are leaſt violent, it is as it were impoſſible that it ſhould ever ſurpriſe this which is altogether in exceſs and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency; The calm it is accompanied withal, cannot agree with the tempeſt it raiſeth; and whether it be formed by the intermiſſion of the Soul which knits and ſtops the ſpirits, or by means of thoſe ſweet vapors which digeſtion ſends up, which like pleaſant clouds tempers the heat of the Brain, and ſhuts the paſſage of the ſences; we ought not to expect that any of theſe cauſes ſhould produce it here wherein there are none but ſharp and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:47499:375"/>vapors, which heated Choler cauſeth to riſe up in the Brain; and wherein the Soul is ſo powerfully agitated, that far from being able to ſtop the Spirits, ſhe cannot retain even herſelf. Yet this ought to be underſtood of the time when this Paſſion is in its rage, and in its greateſt ardor; for when it is a little appeaſed it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſleep to benum the ſences, to repair thoſe loſſes which its watchings and labour hath cauſed.</p>
                        <p>But what reſt ſoever it affords, it forbears not to preſerve in the Soul and in the Humors the remains of that ſtorm which Anger had raiſed in them. For it is commonly diſturbed with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand kinde of Dreams which ſometimes repreſent fires and burnings, ſometimes threatnings, and Combates, and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; now the cauſe of all theſe Dreams comes either from the imagination, which being ſtill full of thoſe ſpecies which Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had there left, and feeling alſo, if we may ſo ſpeak, the ſhake which the deſire of Vengeance had given it, it inſenſibly ſuffers it ſelf to be carried away, and ſo continues its firſt deſigns, which it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cauſeth happily to ſucceed, being no
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:47499:376"/>longer conducted by the Sences, nor by Reaſon, nor taking any other counſel but ſuch as ſelf-love and Pride which Anger brings along with it, affords it. For it is from thence theſe advantages come which a man who ſleeps upon his wrath, believes he receives in all his Dreams; it ſeems to him that he is alwayes the ſtronger, of the better addreſs; he never ſees his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my but he repreſents him unto himſelf ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weak or ſubmitting, and he in them undertakes no combate but he comes off with the Victory and in Triumph.</p>
                        <p>But it may alſo happen, that the Soul may be altogether in a calm, and that no remains of the trouble which the Paſſion had before brought, may ſtay behind; and yet all theſe illuſions will not forbear to happen, and then it is no longer a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of its firſt deſigns, but a new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Spirits and the Humors raiſe in the fancy; for whether their agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſubſiſts after that of the Soul, the impreſſion of the motion, preſerving it ſelf longer in theſe bodies then in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, whether by reaſon Choler being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the maſs of blood, cannot ſo ſoon reſume its juſt place; both are able
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:47499:376"/>to form all theſe violent Dreams which we have ſpoken of: The difficulty is to know how this may be done, ſince theſe things touch not the ſences, which are benummed; nor conſequently the imagination, which works onely on thoſe images which it hath thence received. And were they even at liberty, there is no likelihood that they ſhould know what paſſeth thus in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Veins; What then is it which can raiſe in the Soul all theſe Chimera's and Phantaſms, which have ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with that Motion which the ſpirits then ſuffer, and ſo much reſemblance with that humor which is in diſorder?</p>
                        <p>We muſt certainly confeſs, that beſides this exterior knowledge which the Sences afford her, ſhe hath another which is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and ſecret, which Nature hath inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by means whereof ſhe ſees and knows all what is done in her organs, and that with that light ſhe who is preſent with all the parts, eaſily obſerves what is done in them, and afterwards communicates it to the imagination, which is as it were the center of all her knowledge. But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this is obſcure and confuſed, ſhe inſtructs not this Faculty clearly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:47499:377"/>it onely a general view of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which concern her; it's for the ſame reaſon alſo that ſhe forms no perfect ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which reſpect things as they are, but which onely have ſome relation and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together. So when choler is moved, although the Soul diſtinctly knows not the nature nor the ſpecies, yet ſhe knows it to be a humor which is hot and ardent, and upon the report which ſhe hath made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the imagination, this fancies to it ſelf ſparkling colours, flames and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which have a conformity with that general notion which ſhe had received of them. And becauſe that ſhe alſo knows that this Humor ſerves Anger and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to deſtroy the Enemy which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, ſeeing herſelf in ſuch a condition as in theſe Paſſions ſhe uſeth to be in, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thereupon propoſeth ſuch objects and deſignes, and ſo forms Enemies, Aſſaults, and Combates. We may ſay as much of the agitation which remains in the Spirits after the eſmotion of the Soul is at an end. For obſerving it during ſleep, ſhe who knows that it's the motion which in Anger ſhe makes uſe of, reingageth herſelf afreſh in this Paſſion, and ſleeping reaſſum the deſires and deſigns of reven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> which
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47499:377"/>waking ſhe had already given over. She doth the like alſo proportionably, when the other humors are irregular; when the ſpirits finde themſelves agitated with the motion of ſome other Paſſion; in a word, it is thus, that ſhe forms all Dreams which come from the good or ill diſpoſition of the body, as we have ſhewed in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Love out of Inclination.</p>
                        <p>There remains two effects onely to be examined, concerning which we muſt conſult Phyſick; for it is from her we muſt learn <hi>What Pulſe there is in Anger,</hi> and in what diſpoſition the Heart and the Lungs are when it is kindled in thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>As for the firſt, All Phyſicians are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, <hi>That the Pulſe herein is great, high, quick, frequent, and vehement,</hi> and that the violence of the heat, and force of the vital Faculty, are the principal cauſes of all theſe differences.</p>
                        <p>But although all this be true, yet we may ſay that this kinde of Pulſe is not proper and particular to Anger, ſince it is alſo to be found in Boldneſs, as we decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47499:378"/>treating of that Paſſion; and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there muſt be ſomewhat which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath not been obſerved, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth it from this, there being no probability that theſe two Paſſions ſhould diverſly agitate the Soul and the Spirits, without cauſing alſo in the Heart and in the Arteries different motions: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certain, that in both of them <hi>the pulſe is great and high;</hi> but in Boldneſs it is full and extented, and we may feel the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery under our fingers which ſwells every way; inſtead that in Anger it puts all her endeavor forwards, and without enlarging it ſelf it darts it ſelf outwardly, making the pulſe thereby high, which ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtreight then large. And certainly as the Spirits follow the deſign of the Soul which throws herſelf out of herſelf to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the Enemy, their ſally muſt needs be made as hers is, from the center to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, and that if the Arteries are to be reſtrained as it is neceſſary, and as we ſhall hereafter demonſtrate, it ought to be by the ſides, that the Spirits may be left at liberty to dart themſelves forth; but there is no queſtion to be made of this effect nor of its cauſe, if we remember that Grief and Boldneſs are here mingled together,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:47499:378"/>and that at the ſame time both of them agitate the Heart and the Arteries with a motion proper to them; for if Grief ought to reſtrain it, that Boldneſs at the ſame time might open it, they muſt be ſtreightned in ſome of the parts, and enlarged in others, in purſuit whereof, the Pulſe appears high without being extended, as hath been ſaid; yet we muſt obſerve that it is principally ſo in the motions of Anger, or that when it is in the ardor of Vengeance, or that it turns into Fury, this contraction is no more felt but it is found to be altogether large and full, as it is in Boldneſs; or whether the ſence of Grief be ſtifled, or its effect ſuſpended by the violence of other Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or whether the Soul which is then as it were out of herſelf, minds no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger her preſervation, and without having a care of ſheltering her ſelf, ſhe blindly expoſeth her ſelf to danger, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons her ſelf to all the rage which poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Reſpiration</hi> in this is juſt as it is in Boldneſs; for although it proceeds from the ſame cauſes the Pulſe doth, that it is of the ſame uſe, and that its motions have the ſame relation: yet hath it not all the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:47499:379"/>differences, or at leaſt it hath not made them known, becauſe we are not ſenſible by the touch of the Body of the Lungs where it is formed, as we are ſenſible of that of the Arteries, and that there is not ſuch a tie betwixt that and the reſt of the exterior organs which renders it ſenſible, as there is betwixt the Heart and theſe kind of Veins; for which cauſe there is neither hardneſs nor ſoftneſs in the Reſpiration, as is in the pulſe, nor can we obſerve any thing which comes near this kind of beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we ſaid was proper to Anger; although the Lungs ſuffer the ſame chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and be in the ſame condition as the Heat then is; for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> aſſures us, that in this Paſſion both the one and the other retire and reſtrain themſelves in themſelves, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, although heat at the ſame time ſwells them and lifts them up. Now although we cannot doubt but theſe contrary motions come from the mixture of theſe two Paſſions whereof we have ſpoken; yet it is not eaſie to obſerve how they may be compatible together, nor what parts are deſtined for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, it being not probable that the ſame ſhould be agitated by both together. For we cannot herein ſay of the Heart and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:47499:379"/>Lungs, what we have ſaid of the Arteries, their natural conſtitution and the action which they are obliged to perform, ſuffers them not to be reſtrained, as they are to be lift up: It muſt neceſſarily be that they muſt extend when they open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>But if they extend themſelves ſo, how can they reſtrain themſelves? Certainly, we muſt ſay that their fleſh and ſubſtance gathers comprench and reſtrains it ſelf, and that their cavities enlarge themſelves, inſtead that in Joy all the parts releaſe and ſoften themſelves, having not that need to fortifie themſelves as here they have; in effect, the pulſe which appears harder in Anger then in Boldneſs, is a certain ſign that the ſubſtance of the Arteries reſtrains and hardens it ſelf; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but that the hardneſs of theſe parts comes from the contraction of the Soul, ſince it is for that onely reaſon that the pulſe becomes hard in Fear.</p>
                        <p>All the difficulty remaining is, To know why the Arteries which borrow the vertue of moving themſelves from the Heart, have not a motion like his, and that they ſtreighten their cavity on the ſides,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:47499:380"/>although that enlargeth his own on all ſides.</p>
                        <p>To reſolve this difficulty, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the beating of the Arteries is not the ſame which is in the Heart, ſince thoſe open and lift themſelves up, whilſt this fall and ſhuts it ſelf. So that they muſt needs be too different motions, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proceed from two different ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. And if this be true, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that they ſhould reſemble in all things, and the Heart in any ſence may enlarge it ſelf without any neceſſity for the Arteries to do the ſame; now as the Heart hath its Ventricles placed on the right and left which neceſſarily ought to open themſelves to receive blood and air which enters therein, it's impoſſible the Soul ſhould cauſe it to make a motion conformable to the Paſſions wherewith it is agitated, as is made in the Arteries where this impediment is not, and where ſhe hath all the liberty to ſatisfie Grief by reſtraining them, and Boldneſs by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up, as hath been ſaid. As for the Lungs, there is a particular reaſon for which they cannot reſtrain themſelves as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do; for they have not the power to move themſelves, and of themſelves they
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:47499:380"/>lift themſelves not up to give place to the air which enters. It is the muſcles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, which extending themſelves widen the capacity of the Breaſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Lungs to open, to hinder a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum; for which cauſe waving the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty, they have not thoſe kinds of motion, which depend therefrom.</p>
                        <p>But it is to pry too far into the ſecrets of Phyſick, and the further clearing hereof would be uſeleſs to thoſe who know it, and thoſe who are ignorant of it would never be ſufficiently informed. Let us onely ſay, That although Anger cauſeth often very great diſorders in the Soul and in the Body,
<note place="margin">Anger is profitable to health.</note> yet it is not always an enemy to Reaſon, nor to Health. It is abſolutely neceſſary for weak and idle minds, and for cold and groſs conſtitutions; and even in all others it may be compared to winds, which how impetuous ſoever they are drive away va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and miſts, clearing the air, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it the more pure and wholeſom. In effect, if we ſeek to hinder its courſe, or that we would reſtrain it, without ſuffering it ſo much as to exhale it ſelf by words, it preſerves it ſelf a long time in the Soul, and at laſt alters the humors, whence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen great and pernicious ſickneſſes.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:47499:381"/>For as the inferior part is deaf to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Reaſon, and that ſhe propoſeth to herſelf revenge as the end ſhe tends unto, ſhe will cauſe her motion to ceaſe untill ſhe is at leaſt in ſome manner revenged. So that the Will may then hinder thoſe actions over which it hath a power, ſuch as are words, blows, and the like; but for thoſe which are not under its direction, as are the motions of the Heart, and the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Humors, they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be continued, they muſt even by this reſtraint be rendred the more violent, and they muſt laſt the longer time, ſince we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay our revenge, which is the end which ought to terminate them.</p>
